00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.700
Ji An, let's cry.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.580
Crying doesn't make you weak

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.190
and not crying doesn't make you okay.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.930
You have a shoulder to lean on today.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.640
Use that as an excuse to cry a lot.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.470
It's your hometown oppa advantage.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.810
[Episode 8. First Love Advantage]

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.510
It's your hometown oppa advantage.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.070
Honey, let's eat.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.250
Eat without me.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.830
Bo Hyeon is waiting.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.470
It was like love for humanity.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.280
Out of the kindness of the heart, probably.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.000
Lee Ji An, are you conjuring up
those feelings again?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.300
- Hey.
- You scared me.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.450
Are you a cow or something?

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.200
Why are you regurgitating this morning?

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.030
Hey.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.940
You know the first sign of aging
is talking to yourself, right?

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.600
You talk to the orchid while cleaning it,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.460
talk to the ground after you fall,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.900
and talk to the porridge and ladle like you do now.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.370
That's a classic sign of aging.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.720
You know?

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.060
Gosh, look at you.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.830
Hyo Ri, bring this porridge to Dr. Jung.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.560
I don't want to.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.510
That little...

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.040
I'll go home now.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.100
You should recover and go
to the hospital with me tomorrow.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.510
I said I'm going home.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.700
People are so selfish.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.930
I feel angry, resentful,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.160
and I want to ignore you, too.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.050
But I don't want to teach Hyo Ri to live that way.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.220
Even when you want to give up on everything,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.250
you need to overcome, fight it, and lean on others.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.880
That's what I want to teach her.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.070
So, for Hyo Ri and me,

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.010
please stay with us for now.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.960
Use this room because it's empty.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.420
And we're busy since the shop just opened.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.110
It'd be nice if you could help count the money.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.200
Please eat.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.700
Gosh. What's this? Why am I looking around?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.500
Ryu Jeong Seok, don't take it too far.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.740
Wow. The air is so amazing here.
The view is amazing, too.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.910
Yeong Su heard you came to Korea and asked

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.140
if you could do a presentation at the conference.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.700
I just told him to ask you directly.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.700
Presentation? It'd be strange if I suddenly gave one.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.900
I refuse.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.790
By the way, Honey,

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.300
let's talk privately sometime.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.560
We should talk about Bo Hyeon.
I have something to tell you, too.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.570
Gosh, my, my, that's dangerous. Why...

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.890
She needs to balance while pedaling.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.050
Hello.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.200
D-Did you see me?

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.798
I rode smoothly from all the way back there.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.600
You don't know what smooth means.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.160
Looks like you're surprised by my motor skills.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.400
You've got to be kidding me.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.500
This is what it's like to laugh
out loud. Laugh out loud.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.320
- Is Dr. Jung okay?
- Yes, she's okay.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.800
It's just torture for me, stuck
between Hyo Ri and Dr. Jung.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.010
You need a change of scenery at times like that.

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.530
I'm going to Seoul this week for a conference.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.270
You can join to get some fresh air.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.600
I can't because of the shop.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.970
I should do that.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.600
- Presentation.
- You said you won't.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.600
No, it'd be nice to meet people
in the industry there.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.510
Our school asked me to

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.470
give a presentation regarding my current project.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.840
I see.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.820
They won't leave me alone, right?

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.060
It'd be nice if you came.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.520
But since the subject matters are so deep,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.680
you'd find it very boring.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.980
Right?

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.830
So, you said you'll go?

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.300
"You'll find it very boring."

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.110
She pissed me off when she said that.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.200
So, I said I'll go, and that I like stuff like that.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.630
She's really something.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.480
How did she know that you conk out at those things?

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.140
I mean,

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.320
why is that woman so nasty?

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.870
Even if you fell off the stairs during the lecture,

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.900
your bones will break, not hers.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.630
Why does she care? Go.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.650
Gogeon University, did you say?

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.600
Anyway, I want you to go there to prove yourself.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.020
There's a famous donut shop by that school.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.670
I want you to prove yourself
and bring those back, too.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.340
Hey.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.350
Donuts have nothing to do
with that nasty one, right?

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.920
Right. You're pissed off already.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.670
Not buying the donuts will double your loss.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.300
Gosh, I got the chills.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.500
How are you so logical?

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.700
Gosh, I love it.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.510
Your chemistry has been bothering me a lot.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.490
Our chemistry...

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.310
Are you sick?

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.990
I'm okay.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.790
He seems sick after jumping
into the ocean. So I told him to rest.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.200
- But he won't listen.
- I'm...

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.130
a total man of steel.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.070
Do you want to see it?

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.570
Steel!

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.810
Steel!

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.500
So good.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.580
He's so good. I can't see his feet.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.500
Two, three, four...

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.300
- So fast. I can't see his feet.
- One, two, three, six.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.280
[Farmer]

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.900
- Yeah.
- Come out now.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.840
- What?
- It's urgent. Come out now.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.320
What is it? What?

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.900
- Look.
- So what?

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.230
It's the sprout that came out a few days ago.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.870
They grew at least 2 mm each.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.540
Can't you tell?

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.900
Hey.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.330
They grow while hearing the farmer's footsteps.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.700
You should come, walk around,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.700
and tell them they're doing great,
so they grow bigger.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.400
Should we get some sun since we're here

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.700
and have fun weeding, too?

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.300
Let's. Let's have fun weeding

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.600
- and clear our thoughts, too.
- Okay.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.080
Hello.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.610
It's too hot.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.740
Let's call it a day.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.110
Take care.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.120
Why won't the color deepen?

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.470
Is it because I switched the soy sauce?

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.020
Is it?

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.240
Why are you sweating so much?

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.950
I'm sweating because we're making broth.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.000
I know.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.500
The vegetables are boiling.
But why are you sweating?

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.900
Gosh, you have a fever.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.200
- You're right.
- You got sick from jumping into the ocean.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.100
- I mean-
- I'm okay.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.200
I'm really okay.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.000
You aren't okay.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.660
You need to rest.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.140
Follow me.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.180
We have a guest room for times like this.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.380
Look at your sweat. Goodness. My gosh.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.000
I'm okay.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.990
I recover quickly after taking a quick nap.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.440
Gosh.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.000
I want you to promise me.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.900
Not when you think you're okay,

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.850
but come back to work
when you've completely recovered.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.000
I'm really strong.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.450
I said I can work with full energy tomorrow.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.000
Unexpectedly, you follow your head.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.670
I've been told...

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.860
I have the brain of a genius

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:11.700
pretty often.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.200
Not your brain. Your head.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.700
You look like you'd follow your heart,
but you follow your head.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.590
Your body is saying, "I'm sick."

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.810
But your head is saying, "No, you're strong."

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:26.280
Why won't you listen to your body?

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.030
When you're having a hard time,

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.720
you need to know how to bend and fall.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.110
That makes you truly strong.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:42.770
Rest well and come back
with a healthy body and mind.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.420
Sleep.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.860
Why won't you ask me anything?

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.380
A few words can't comfort you.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.870
I'll just...

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.120
be by your side quietly.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:24.080
And if you no longer want to wander alone

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.720
or you've sorted things out... Anyway,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.520
if you need someone at some point,

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.470
I'll be by your side then, too.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.980
How's it? Is it good?

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.000
Hey.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.130
- Are you ready to go?
- Yeah.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.400
Aren't you too underdressed for a conference?

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.500
I'm not presenting. Aren't I
just supposed to clap hard?

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.430
Is that right?

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.490
They're here.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.300
I didn't know she was so pretty.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.100
Her scarf is nice, too. She's like Audrey Hepburn.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.580
- Isn't the scarf too much?
- It's too much.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.480
It'd make her neck sweaty.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.700
She'll step on it or get it caught in a door.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.500
That'd be better. If you get caught
on a car window, you die.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.360
Why is her skin so taut?

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.090
Look at Ji An.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:53.020
She hit the passage of time honestly with her face.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.200
That's enough.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.310
Should I bring out my jewelry?

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.100
You're falling behind in looks.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.040
You'd have to wear jewelry and
show off wealth instead.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:03.840
Seriously.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.380
- Where's she going?
- Where are you going?

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.610
Where's she going?

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.800
- I'll be right back!
- Hey!

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.210
Hey, hey!

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.500
Hey!

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.630
She's wearing a scarf. She's wearing a scarf.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.850
She's wearing a scarf. All set. It's over.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.740
She just needed a scarf.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.000
I heard Dong Min and Hyeon Su were coming, too.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.400
Do you see them sometimes?

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.700
No. I just see Yeong Su sometimes.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.800
The school has changed so much.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.760
They expanded the pharmacy
building and built the new central library.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.900
That's why it felt different.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.920
Being back on campus makes me
want to go back to my 20s.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.520
Don't you agree?

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.600
Gosh, why is this field so huge? I'm dying.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.830
Since Hyo Ri and Bo Hyeon did a lot,

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.840
there are hardly any weeds.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.870
I was surprised.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.780
Yes. That won't let you leave early.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.100
We need to weed this whole place to go home today.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.900
- Who said I won't?
- Get to it.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.460
It's a hot day. Let's not overdo it.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.170
Gosh, Bo Hyeon. Are you very hot?

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:33.080
Should we not overdo it and go home?

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.550
Bo Hyeong must hate her acting like that.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.100
Hey, I'm smart.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.360
I refused to study. I wasn't bad at it.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.490
Okay.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.500
I'm serious. Really.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.610
Hey, you know. Tell her.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.320
Okay, fine.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.500
Anyway,

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.500
the academic background is the
only thing you're better at than I am.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.900
Let's fight fair and square for love-

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.000
You know, we smooched.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.150
Or a kiss?

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.390
Kiss?

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.480
You bitch. Hey.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.100
Hey...

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.160
You little vixen... Hey, when did you...

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.240
When did you kiss?

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.710
Where... Where did you?

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.070
Stop. Hey!

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.600
Let go.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.270
Where did you kiss?

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.943
Where did you kiss? Hey!

00:20:47.943 --> 00:20:51.000
I just thought I should make things clear.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.700
Well, I'm not sure if this was the
only way to do that, but...

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.940
it wasn't bad.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.120
[Gogeon Architecture Annual Forum -
Speaking of Living Space]

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.160
It's going to be super boring.
Are you ready for it?

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.130
I'm more academic than you think.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:19.520
Jeong Seok.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.540
Excuse me.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.650
Gosh, hey.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.900
They're so happy to see each other after 10 years.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.900
- Isn't it fascinating?
- You must know everyone.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.500
I used to be kind of famous.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.500
I went up on stage during
a school festival my freshman year

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.940
and confessed my feelings to Jeong Seok.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.880
Everyone knew me since then.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.400
He's my first love.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.960
I thought we were meant to be,
but it didn't work out.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.720
But I can get him back.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.800
- Sunbae.
- Yeo Jeong.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.400
Long time no see, Sunbaenim.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.540
How could you always be so beautiful?

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.840
Come on.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.150
Everyone's looking forward to the Cheonghae project.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.400
You came briefly for work, right?

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.800
It's for work and for love, too.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.740
Are you getting back together?

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.370
No, right?

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.130
Well, maybe.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.220
Look forward to it.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.900
So wonderful.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.330
- Wow.
- Let's stand by.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.020
- Go fill up the seats.
- Okay.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.730
I'm so nervous.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.980
Do you think I could do well?

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.750
- Let's go upstairs.
- Yes.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.030
The fundamental principle of organic architecture

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.360
is coexisting with the surrounding nature.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.420
I spend most of my time thinking about that.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.100
The nature was the land's owner
for thousands of years.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.360
Considering its fate with the
building that will join them

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.700
for the next hundreds of years...

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.460
Considering the future of the building for the

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.940
next decades and hundreds of years,

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.960
it'd be good to listen to the ones
who worked hard on the site-

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.400
I understand.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.900
We'll make the decision.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.390
By working closely with the environmental
groups, who experienced

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.300
and thought about the local ecosystem for years,

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.900
I worked to achieve their coexistence.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.000
Nature isn't just a backdrop
or an accessory to the building.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.200
It holds an equal value...

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.480
I'll go to the restroom.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.290
and an attitude to understand as its partner.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:55.800
Yes. Architecture can no longer

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.790
stay a human-centered sculpture.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.590
Gosh, I feel achy.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:04.540
Studying really isn't for me.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.600
Is she impressive or shameless?

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.300
Jeong Seok supported her
for years while caring for their son.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.500
How could she cheat on him there?

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.310
If Jeong Seok is acting that way knowingly,

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.850
he'd be stupid, not saintly.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.130
See you later.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.020
Thank you.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.460
There will be an after party. You're coming, right?

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:46.050
Ji An would probably feel uncomfortable, right?

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:50.410
How far will you drag me down?

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:51.710
What?

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.630
Is it because I mentioned us getting back together?

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.190
I didn't drag you down.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.030
I was sincere.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.980
I want us to start over.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.410
I wanted to tell you properly.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:11.230
You haven't changed.

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.170
You think and act selfishly.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.800
You act as if you're being nice by being

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.500
honest without caring about
what the other person thinks.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.100
Lee Yeo Jeong, people suffer losses,

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.400
and let the other person win
for his sake and endure.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.400
Some people call that caring or even love.

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.310
But you know what I learned from you?

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.800
That I can't waste that gesture

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.190
on someone who doesn't know its value.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.560
We'll never get back together.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.600
Watch your mouth in front of people.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.360
I won't tolerate it next time.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.860
Is it because of Ji An?

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.140
Get your facts straight.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.580
It's because of you, not Ji An.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.980
Seriously!

00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:59.090
Hey!

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.600
We were a bit like stars
in a coming-of-age movie, huh?

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.100
Oppa, don't I look sweet
and innocent when I'm wet?

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.800
Hey, acting like this at our age

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.300
makes us look pathetic, not sweet and innocent.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.800
Why can't you clean yourself properly?

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.710
Come here.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.530
My goodness. Seriously.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:55.490
You're acting as if we're close.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.430
It's okay. I'll do it.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.990
Why were you checking out
the building so thoroughly?

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:04.800
Is it your occupational obsession?

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.910
I worked on this building's construction site.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.120
- Really?
- Yes.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.480
When I worked here,

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.700
I entered the campus with the college students.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.900
I felt excited because
I felt like I was one of them.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:24.360
I understood the meaning of youthfulness.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.570
They looked so sweet.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.230
I wonder if that why.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:49.400
I didn't usually think about my dad,

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.110
but I thought of him a lot while working here.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.010
"Some people build memories on campus,

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.600
and I build brick walls instead.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.370
Do you pay to go here? I get paid to come here."

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.230
I tried to act all cool,

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.320
but if my dad were alive,
would my situation been different?

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.980
That's when I first thought that.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.110
You must've been sad.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:16.440
No.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.600
Thinking now, the result probably

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.300
would have been the same in the end.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.580
I have Hyo Ri.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.370
It would've been her in the end,
no matter what happened.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.500
Yes, it would've been Hyo Ri.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.750
Since I have her, I don't feel at a loss or upset.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.730
I cheered myself up thinking that.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.600
So, you also did the right thing.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.540
Did I do something?

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:57.800
Even when you felt wronged, exhausted,

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.300
or upset, you probably endured things,

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.330
by waiting and accepting them because of Bo Hyeon.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.590
That's how you probably have lived.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.250
So, you did a good job.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.030
You hung in there well.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.430
I'll go to the restroom.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.240
Jeong Seok supported her for years.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.440
How could she cheat on him there?

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.590
If he's acting this way knowingly,

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.870
he'd be stupid, not saintly.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.340
I know how that feels a little bit.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.500
That's why I suddenly wanted to tell you that.

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.280
Other people might not know, but I do.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.700
How you hung in there all this time.

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.300
So, you did great.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.060
By the way, you...

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:14.060
Huh?

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:18.250
Don't fall asleep.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:21.240
I'd get sleepy while driving if you fell asleep.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.400
I told you. I can't sleep because I'm sensitive.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.200
Yeah, right.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.000
I was exhausted that day.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.640
How could you not know yourself at that age?

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.440
You think you know me better?

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.690
Other people might not know, but I do.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:52.720
How you hung in there all this time.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.210
What a fool.

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.990
Why did he tear up?

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.980
I almost wiped his tears.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.870
By the way, you...

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:09.130
Huh?

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.510
You looked pretty today.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.180
Auntie.

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.800
Huh? Hyo Ri.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.110
Hey, are you crazy?

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.700
Get out.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.880
Because you were mopey like seaweed,

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.550
you got Seon Yeong to kick me out, too.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:24.880
Because you keep zoning out,

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.940
she was frustrated and kicked me out, too.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.920
We have nothing to do outside.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.250
Whatever.

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:33.360
Let's have fun since Seon Yeong told us to.

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.700
Or I'll get slapped on my back again.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.100
- Chef Kim
- Gosh, hello.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.270
Why are you alone?

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.640
Tae Oh is home because he's sick.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.300
Hyo Ri and her mom went downtown briefly.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.790
Right. I wanted to give you this.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:04.030
It's my homemade bread.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.020
Gosh, thank you.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.700
Do you bake bread, too?

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.760
Well, it's for someone else.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.460
Who?

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:22.200
Hello.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:24.670
Try some of this.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.700
I made this potato bread myself.

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:41.020
What a well-built house.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.380
The views are pretty everywhere.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.860
Try some of this.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:52.090
Try it.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.450
The potatoes were delicious.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:59.010
What do you think?

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.040
It's delicious.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.420
I'm happy that you like it.

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.320
I...

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.790
heard about your situation.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.540
At our age,

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.800
some of us let our kids go first.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:37.620
I did, too.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:41.550
When my son was less than 30,

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.320
I sent him away before me, too.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.870
It's already...

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.120
been 10 years.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:53.770
That's why...

00:37:54.700 --> 00:38:00.000
I can kind of understand how you feel. Just a bit.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:04.870
There are...

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:06.970
hundreds of reasons to die.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.400
But you can't...

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.920
think of a single reason to live.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.020
I know how that feels.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.560
So,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
did you find the reason to live?

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.860
I...

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.180
have to remember him.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.480
I need to live...

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:43.550
to remember my son for a long time,

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:45.350
love him,

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:50.710
and cry...

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.420
for my son.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.830
His mother has to do that.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:02.030
Otherwise, his life seemed...

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.120
too empty.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:10.640
You should think about it, too.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.600
Even with a hundred reasons to die,

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.600
if you have just one reason to live,

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.450
you can hang in there...

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.820
in our lives.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.600
- Chef Kim, I'm back.
- Tae Oh.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.380
- Gosh.
- You must've been worried.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.200
My gosh.

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:49.030
Gosh. Okay.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.830
Yes. I was very worried.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:56.170
I'm glad you recovered quickly.

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:58.930
As you told me to, I rested well

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:02.600
and returned with a healthy body

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.890
and pure spirit.

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:05.300
Yes. Okay.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.400
Thank you for getting back your health.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.450
But your pure spirit...

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:15.500
is a bit concerning.

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:19.800
Just go back to being an attentive spirit.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.210
Got it.

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:24.110
I'll start cleaning first, then.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.440
Go.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.550
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's go.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:36.830
I'm so happy to see your face.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.260
Okay.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.190
See? There's so much to see.

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:54.000
It's fun.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.400
- Can we try the shikhye?
- Of course. Try it.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.350
My husband made it.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.660
Hello.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.820
So pretty.

00:41:09.563 --> 00:41:10.600
Mom...

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.560
- Why did you laugh?
- No, it's pretty.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.420
- Isn't it funny?
- It's pretty.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.610
Should we get one for Auntie, too?

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.740
These would be so comfortable in the kitchen.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.380
They're so soft.

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:24.630
- What do you think?
- Put this on you.

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:29.890
- Does it look okay?
- This, too.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.770
Hey,

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.160
this is so good.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.400
Should we sell this, too?

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.700
Don't you have business ethics?

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.800
Sell what you're good
at making without overlapping.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.340
You're always right,

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.840
but you strangely make me not want to accept it.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.990
It's because I take after you.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.460
Aren't you so clever?

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:00.030
[One day self-portrait class]

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:01.840
Let's do this.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.400
♫ Don't lock the door ♫

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:10.430
♫ When the love comes to you ♫

00:42:11.834 --> 00:42:12.870
Hello.

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:14.770
Hello.

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:16.860
Is this your first painting class?

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.000
Yes, we've never done anything like this.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.810
Is that so? Let's make it easy.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:23.350
- Let's go slow.
- Okay.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.600
Today, we'll paint a self-portrait.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.660
From your phone,

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.180
find a photo you like the most.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.050
- A photo of yourself?
- Yes.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.000
You must have a lot of self-love.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.510
- Well, yes.
- Wow...

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:40.000
Here's the photo.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.950
Put this carbon paper on the canvas.

00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:44.900
- Carbon paper.
- Do you know what it is?

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.370
Of course. I've used it in school.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.560
Making art has to be fun.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.750
Yes.

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:55.580
We'll draw lines tracing this photo.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.510
- Use the pen.
- Okay.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.350
Ma'am, ma'am, you can't shave off your jaw.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:06.140
- It was when I gained weight.
- No, no.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.590
I look a bit different now. So...

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:10.300
it needs to look like me now.

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.960
You look the same. Trace it exactly, still.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.300
I don't think so...

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:20.380
We'll choose the colors for the skin.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:24.180
Have a look. This is a summer tone.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.530
Yes.

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:27.190
There are many kinds, right?

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.750
- All are nice.
- Don't just enjoy them. Choose one.

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:33.600
- Recommend one for me.
- Should I?

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.440
For the daughter...

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.940
How's pink?

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.330
- Pink?
- It represents possibilities.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.730
- That's cool.
- Okay.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.590
For the mother...

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.070
How's this one? It's like Hulk.

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.700
Hulk? Why?

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:50.020
Looking at your lines,

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.900
even though you've never drawn before,

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.110
but with this talent,

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:55.600
I think you might have a hidden superpower.

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.370
Really? I should do Hulk, then.

00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:01.270
You're doing great. Just like that.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.900
Don't go over the lines.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:07.230
Mother, use your hidden superpower
as much as you can.

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:10.040
She's good.

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:14.060
Looks like you've done this before.

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:17.170
It's my first time.

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:21.460
There.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:26.110
Isn't it fascinating?

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:28.590
I thought only artists could do this.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:30.380
You have a talent.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.000
You should start nurturing it.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.100
Come on. Everyone can draw like me.

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:37.890
- You know your paintings we have at home?
- Yes.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.720
I'm not sure if they're good,

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.630
but they're very Lee Ji An.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:46.570
I can't tell if it's a compliment or not.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.800
Not Mom, Manager Lee, or Ms. Lee.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.500
But exactly Lee Ji An.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.590
I could sense a side of you I don't know of.

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:59.190
So, I thought it was very Lee Ji An.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:02.010
I liked it.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.660
So, you should nurture your talent.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.520
Okay. Once the shop gets settled down,

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.360
I'll think about it later.

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:14.800
By the way, are you feeling okay?

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.140
Aren't you tired?

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.410
The new meds seem to agree with me.

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:21.100
My heart doesn't palpitate anymore, either.

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.730
Huh? Look, look.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.900
Give me a lot.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.950
No. They're all kids.

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:33.940
Hey, kids don't care about the
ambience or trend at that age.

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.990
They only care about getting good deals.

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:38.030
Let's go. It has to be good.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.100
How surprising.

00:45:49.100 --> 00:45:52.150
Why is eating tteokbokki
while listening to the waves so romantic?

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:53.300
I know.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.980
How could tteokbokki be so atmospheric?

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:04.200
Why have you been in a bad mood lately?

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.510
It doesn't seem like you fought with Bo Hyeon.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.410
Is it because of Dr. Jung?

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.700
You could be mad at her, but-

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.430
I'm not mad at her.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:18.410
You aren't?

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.020
What's wrong, then?

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.590
The entire family tiptoes around you.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.400
- It's because of you.
- Me?

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.310
What about me?

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.750
Thank you for enjoying them.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:43.350
I feel great.

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:45.300
I enjoyed them.

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:47.500
Okay.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:51.700
Call me if you crave more later.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:57.600
By the way, Hyo Ri...

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:03.600
probably thought of her mom looking at you.

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:07.120
"If I'm gone,

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:12.300
would my mom also..."

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.790
Thinking that.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.200
I'll go now.

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:21.240
I was afraid...

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:26.460
I was afraid you'd end up

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:29.690
like Dr. Jung...

00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:31.990
if I'm gone.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.710
The biggest fear I had
when I found out about my condition...

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:44.160
"My mom only cares about me.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.770
If...

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.150
I end up dying, how would she live?"

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.510
That was my biggest fear.

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:13.250
Wait here.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:23.940
- Sir.
- Yes.

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.880
[Art studio yearly membership]
Happy now?

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:56.950
Listen carefully.

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:59.630
I can't believe I'm saying this,

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.300
but by chance...

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.800
by a slim chance,

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.280
if something happens to you,

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.580
I'll live my own life.

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.380
I'll live the rest of my days fully

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.000
and spend each day

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.750
by working hard and cherishing it.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:23.230
I swear that on my name.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:37.860
That's what I wanted to hear the
most since I became sick.

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.290
Thank you.

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:08.490
We're...

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:14.050
finally learning how to truly live for each other.

00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:16.320
Right?

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.600
Gosh!

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:46.790
Can I learn how to use this?

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:52.760
I'm not so sure.

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.340
It's very hard.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.150
Would you be able to?

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:58.640
I know.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.360
Wouldn't it be...

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:02.600
better if you kept a ledger by hand?

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.940
Yes, that'd be better.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.720
I...

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:09.470
I am a doctor.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.410
Okay. Let's see, then.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:15.200
First of all,

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:18.000
if you press this button...

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.570
Gosh, the computer is on.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.420
Next...

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.390
- Welcome back.
- Where's Hyo Ri?

00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:34.360
She went to see Bo Hyeon.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:36.030
What's she doing?

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.730
She wanted to learn how to use the register.

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:43.920
Wouldn't an abacus be better?

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.580
I said I'm a doctor.

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:50.430
Yes, Doctor.

00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:52.430
Shall we start, then?

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:55.480
Select a table first.

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.130
Table.

00:51:57.130 --> 00:51:59.060
Gosh, this is hard.

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:02.100
That's it.

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:04.530
Okay. Now select bossam.

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:06.830
Press it. Bossam.

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:12.700
You're so impressive.

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:16.400
- Next.
- Can you select order next?

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:19.500
Order.

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.860
Can you? Can you? Can you?

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.240
Yes! Success.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.580
Wow. I'm so impressed.

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.500
Not just anyone can be a doctor.

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:36.700
Can you finish the sash enforcement by tomorrow?

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.920
Yes. So, we can get lumber tomorrow.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.700
I made it clear with them.

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.750
Team Leader, everything okay, right?

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:45.500
Of course, I'm very okay.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.800
I really nagged the sash team.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.410
So our schedule doesn't get disrupted.

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:52.300
I'm monitoring them very closely.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.480
Good job, Team Leader.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.060
Thank you, brother.

00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:58.360
And...

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:01.800
I'll schedule the library construction in advance.

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.170
- No, no.
- Gosh.

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:04.870
Don't betray me.

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:07.260
- No.
- Don't feel pressured and keep it.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:09.480
Seriously.

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.930
Isn't this from the restaurant nearby?

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:16.190
- Yes.
- It tells you to only take one.

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.380
This is what Ji An likes.

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:27.430
Bo Hyeon.

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:29.900
I just had a date with my mom.

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:30.940
I see.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:33.190
- Did you come to brag about it?
- Yes.

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:35.300
I painted a picture, too.

00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:39.470
Ta-da.

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:41.090
It's a self-portrait.

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:44.740
What?

00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:47.700
- Do you want to be an alien?
- Hey.

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.360
This shows my potential.

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.510
I see.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:52.460
Do you want to see something funny?

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:53.930
What is it?

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.250
She must love Shrek.

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:05.410
It's a Hulk green, not Shrek green.

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:07.130
The title is,

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:09.700
"I'm finally using my superpower."

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:11.960
Yes. That's perfect for her.

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.720
- Right?
- Yes.

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.490
My mom...

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:19.660
said she'll never live like Dr. Jung.

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:22.900
Mom said she'll...

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.720
live each day of her life fully from now on.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.380
She got a membership at the art studio, too.

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:40.390
Is that what you were scared and worried about?

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:50.610
Yes.

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:01.290
You must've been so scared.

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:13.330
But you're by my side.

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:16.900
You'll be by my side.

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:19.400
I can just come to you.

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.600
So, I didn't feel that scared.

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:17.790
- Hyo Ri.
- Hello.

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:19.720
I'll give you a ride. Get in.

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.650
- Well...
- Yes?

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:37.560
I took a trip to this village...

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.960
to see you, to be honest.

00:56:40.952 --> 00:56:41.980
Me?

00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.790
So, how does it look, Mr. Ryu?

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:47.400
My mom is tough as nails,

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:49.260
but she sparkled like a girl

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.150
when she talked about her first love.

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:53.990
So, I was always curious

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:56.070
what her first love was like.

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:59.540
And I saw an article about you in a magazine.

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:01.810
The name and the hometown were the same.

00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:04.440
So, I got excited and looked for you.

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.620
Really?

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:07.710
I heard Mom was totally smitten with you.

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:10.120
Because she kept following you around,

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:14.010
you got scared and ran away from her, she said.

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:18.900
So, I corrected her.

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:22.500
That you weren't her first love, but her first unrequited love.

00:57:23.550 --> 00:57:25.570
First unrequited love?

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:33.670
I...

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:38.500
feel too ashamed to face you and Hyo Ri.

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.070
I wondered how much you must've struggled.

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:50.090
I tried to understand how you felt.

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:54.140
All I could do was cry.

00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:57.580
You knew you shouldn't,

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.850
but you didn't want to live.

00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:03.060
I understand that feeling so well.

00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:05.000
Really,

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.230
all I could do was cry.

00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:14.670
Hyo Ri keeps worrying about me these days.

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:19.200
I thought it was because she was sick,

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:23.590
but I guess she's always been like that.

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:27.080
Since I lack in so many ways as a mom,

00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:30.190
she worried that I'd worry.

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:32.880
She was struggling, but she couldn't even show it.

00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:35.590
She never even threw a tantrum.

00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:37.420
That's how she grew up.

00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:43.430
But since I came here,

00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:45.170
she started...

00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:48.060
sharing her worries and disappointments with me.

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:52.640
I finally feel like I'm doing my job as her mom.

00:58:56.690 --> 00:59:00.260
I heard your daughter asked you
to come while struggling.

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:04.060
Doctor,

00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:07.820
you were so dependable that she could

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.150
be honest about her struggles.

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.270
So,

00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:19.130
you need to keep being a cool mom

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.080
whom she trusted and relied on

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:24.760
when she was struggling the most.

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:30.090
And...

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:34.900
if you still feel like life is a burden,

00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:37.950
lean on Hyo Ri and me.

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:39.950
We'll do the same.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.400
Ji An,

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.600
can I ask you a favor?

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:12.080
How did you end up coming together?

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.820
I ran into him on the way.

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:17.160
He said he was stopping by to see you briefly.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.000
Were you waiting for Hyo Ri?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.080
My telepathy reached you.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.070
I was going to ask you something, anyway.

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:23.760
Go inside, Hyo Ri.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:53.300
I felt I owed you a proper apology.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.540
I'm sorry.

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:03.060
I shouldn't have done that,
regardless of the reason.

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:06.780
I'm sorry.

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.740
I'm sorry.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.730
That won't happen...

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.980
anymore, right?

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.250
Someone told me...

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.310
that even if you have hundreds of reasons to die,

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:40.200
one reason to live lets you go on.

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:44.190
But your mom...

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
told me a reason for me to live.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:53.790
She told me...

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.480
to stay as a dependable mom...

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.110
whom my daughter could rely on.

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:07.200
I want to give that a try.

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:49.440
To get Dr. Jung and Hyo Ri to talk,

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.540
I have to take a walk at night with you?

01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:54.730
It's nice that you get to exercise.

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:58.300
Exercising is crucial during menopause.

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:02.300
I'm sorry, but I'm nowhere near male menopause.

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:08.370
Your body is definitely aging.

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:09.900
I'm not.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:12.400
Your face gets red when you're angry.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.700
You shake when you're cold.
You can't stand the heat.

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.550
Your hands and feet feel numb
when you sit for too long, right?

01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:20.910
It's 100%. 100%.

01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:22.950
Definitely in male menopause.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.320
I said I'm not.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.100
I love how you react.

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:33.900
You've been easy to tease since the 1990s.

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:39.600
Having silly talks with you like this

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.370
makes me feel a lot better.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.690
I wanted to live casually,

01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:45.070
but serious things keep happening.

01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:47.870
I guess I've been tired lately.

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:49.050
Really?

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:52.000
If so, I should...

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.990
boost your energy, then.

01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:56.630
Here!

01:03:57.590 --> 01:03:58.940
I love these.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:00.190
It's a hometown oppa advantage.

01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:02.650
Call me when you run out. I'll replenish them.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:04.800
You're happy.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.460
All right, then. Buy one and get one free.

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:11.200
Hometown oppa advantage
and the first love advantage.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.600
I'll let you act bratty on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays.

01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:17.930
First love?

01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:20.900
W-Who says you were my first love?

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:22.610
I know I am.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:26.800
No. You weren't my first love.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.700
When did I say I was your first love?

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.470
You were my first love.

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:36.170
That's why I'm giving you the first love advantage.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.900
What are you saying? Hey, look.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.050
As the recession continues,

01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:51.700
the market prices have been going up.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.700
Hey, that's your problem.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:02.200
Hey! Jeong Seok's girlfriend is here!

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.020
Oh, my gosh!

01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:25.340
You were...

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:28.470
my first love.

01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:44.310

01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:28.757
Are you wearing a hairpin?

01:06:28.757 --> 01:06:29.740
Get in.

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:32.810
You confessed your love or vice versa?

01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:35.070
Suk is coming! Suk is coming!

01:06:35.070 --> 01:06:36.630
- Did you kiss him?
- Hey!

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:39.170
To be honest, I hate to lose.

01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:42.570
How about you reach an agreement
with a physical fight?

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.820
Hey.

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:46.300
Someone got injured.

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.970
I came back to Korea to have
a fresh start with Jeong Seok.

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.110
I think I'm broken.

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:55.030
To me,

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.730
you're a time machine. Did you know?

01:06:57.730 --> 01:06:59.080
When I'm with you,

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:02.730
I feel like a 17-year-old all over again.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.990
Can we love again?
