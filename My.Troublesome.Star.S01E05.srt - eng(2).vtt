[Characters, locales, organizations, religion,

[Child actors were filmed safely and
under the guardian supervision]

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.150
Ma'am.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.780
Let go. Let go of me.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.490
The CEO will be home soon.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.370
Let go, I said!

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.680
Did she actually hit her?

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.160
Cut!

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.110
I'm not as strong as I used to be.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.410
Director Ju, let's go one more time.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.450
I clenched my teeth too hard
when I shook off her hand.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.090
Didn't I look wrinkly?

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.210
I thought it was fine.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.990
Okay.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.050
One more time.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.310
Let's go one more time.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.750
Ma'am, the CEO will be home soon.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.510
Let go, I said!

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.640
Cut! Okay!

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.990
Nice!

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.090
Next scene!

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.450
No, no! One more time.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.920
I thought it was good.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.990
Let's do it one more time.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.710
Let's do it again, okay?

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.980
One more time.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.410
Let go, I said!

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.890
Is she insane?

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.890
Stay back.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.130
Let go. That psycho keeps doing that.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.600
It's because she's upset
about her divorce right now.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.540
She's getting divorced again?
Why let it out on an innocent person?

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.350
Let go!

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.710
Cut!

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.880
Sunbaenim, I think that's enough.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.960
I'm finally feeling it.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.740
Let's do it one last time.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.290
One last time.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.790
Seriously.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.900
We need to go now.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.660
It's time.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.590
Get up now.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.210
Get up right now.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.610
What are you doing here?

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.710
Get up.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.950
Who are you?

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.920
- What are you doing?
- What about you?

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.970
What are you doing right now?

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.600
Who's he?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.810
Hold on. We aren't done shooting yet.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.490
You okayed earlier, right?

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.060
It's over. Let's go.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.600
- Hold on.
- Come out right now.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.980
What's going on?

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.700
What are you doing right now?

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.100
What about you? What are you trying to do?

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.610
Acting, you say?

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.240
Don't you still get the situation?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.910
And you want to come back
only to be treated like this?

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.820
It's because...

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.590
I can only be treated this way now.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.580
That's why you should leave instead
of humiliating yourself more.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.620
I never expected to be treated
well when I came back.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.580
I'm Bong Cheong Ja right now, not Im Se Ra.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.810
If I lose this chance,

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.230
I don't know how long I have to wait.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.520
I'm just a minor role.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.710
If I leave now,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.700
it'd really be over.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.810
We shot this.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.670
[Episode 5]
I'm sorry, Director.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.900
I'm sorry.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.450
I thought you left.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.220
I can't leave before my great senior.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.770
Let's call it a day. Wrap it up.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.040
See you tomorrow.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.610
Sunbaenim, I'm sorry.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.860
This is why I don't want to work with nobodies.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.900
Don't you have any manners?

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.620
How dare you leave before your senior?

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.300
Well, that person earlier...

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.820
So, he's...

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.730
my manager.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.280
He was overzealous earlier...

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.480
A manager is as good as the actor.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.830
How dare he scream on set?

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.960
I-I'll talk to the director and
make sure we shoot again.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.000
Who do you think you are?

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.810
Sunbaenim! Sunbaenim-

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.800
Let's go.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.500
What brought you here anyway?

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.830
It sounded like you had something to say earlier.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.940
Let's talk on the way.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.440
Unni.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.020
Unni, it must've hurt.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.230
I'm sorry. Put this on your face.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.920
You went through a lot, Unni.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.890
You, too, little sis.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.600
You're the one who had a hard time.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.990
Your cheeks were puffed up from
gaining weight. They look even puffier.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.440
- Gosh.
- I'm the one who went through a lot.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.630
Crazy, come on...

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.400
Ms. Bong, you must've forgotten
how to work on set.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.360
Since you'd get slapped anyway,
you should've gone for one shot and fall.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.890
How much time did you end up wasting?

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.340
Who are you?

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.200
Nice to meet you.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.500
- I'm Ms. Bong Cheong Ja's-
- He's my manager.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.000
I hired one because I thought I'd get busy.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.780
Aigoo! You don't know that yet.
But you hired one already?

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.530
You were her manager. My goodness.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.390
It's nice that we met like this.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.590
Join us for the afterparty.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.670
Unni went through too much today. Let's go.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.810
- No.
- Have a drink and forget everything.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.690
- We need to drink on a day like this.
- No, thank you. I'm-

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.570
- No.
- Let's go. Let's go.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.360
- No...
- I'll buy you a drink.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.080
I'm not going unless it's an omakase.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.860
Wow. You can order like this?

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.130
What a new world.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.750
Unni, it's my treat. Order everything.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.780
Are you sure you don't remember?

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.700
I heard you weren't in a coma for 25 years.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.280
Aren't you faking it?

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.470
Why would I fake such a thing?

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.130
I really don't remember.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.720
I'm frustrated, too.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.880
How did I end up looking like this?

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.180
Why? You could've been just fine.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.200
You used to be skinny, but you're chubby now.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.790
You probably were better off than you think.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.280
- Tae Suk.
- Yes?

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.900
Can I beat up your husband?

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.060
Unni, he's still my husband.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.370
I'll beat him.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.710
Why would you say such a thing?

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.490
- Are you leaving?
- I'll get going now.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.490
Gosh, gosh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.290
We talked amongst ourselves too much. How rude.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.890
Where do you think you're going?

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.120
Today is a special day. Sit.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.570
I forgot to remove my laundry.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.730
You didn't. You can just wash it again.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.740
It'd be smelly even if you dried it now. Sit.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.650
We just had a shoot today. Come on.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.110
I'm Min Tae Suk.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.080
I'm Cheong Ja's best friend.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.960
You lost touch for over 20 years.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.560
If you're best friends, what are other friends...

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.500
You must know me since I'm famous,

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.150
- but I'm Gu Nam Ju.
- I'm Dokgo Cheol.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.340
Even your name is cool.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.180
Gosh, what was that earlier on set?

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.030
What was that, anyway?

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.110
When you grabbed her wrist and left,

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.660
I thought I was watching a drama.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.010
What's your relationship with Unni?

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.350
I told you earlier. He's just my manager.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.520
You're just an extra. What manager?

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.630
- Aren't you two an item?
- I know, right?

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.710
Didn't you start living together
while you went under the radar?

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.440
I'm right, aren't I?

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.950
- Not at all.
- Not at all.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.480
I suppose he could do a lot better.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.620
Geez.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.700
Hey, Gu Dae Pal.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.600
Don't call my name outside.
You're Bong Cheong Ja yourself.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.260
- What about my name?
- You called me by my real name.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.370
How dare you point at me...

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:17.640
They've always been like that.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.320
They always fought whenever they met.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.650
They looked like they were close in the drama.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.410
Really? Gosh.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.290
Hey, I'm a celeb.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.700
By chance, have you seen me way back when?

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.400
- Have you two met before?
- Hold on.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.650
I'm not sure. I don't remember.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.280
Manager,

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.410
you're from Busan, right?

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.260
How did you know?

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.200
See? I knew it.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.720
I could tell from your accent.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.760
I can hear a bit of the Busan accent
in your Seoul accent.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.600
My mom is from Busan.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.480
I thought I fixed my accent.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.330
Could you tell?

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.760
I had no idea.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.620
Are you really not from Seoul?

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.280
Thinking now, your relationship
with Busan goes way back.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.220
You've even been to a Busan
police station back then.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.350
Gosh, why would you bring that up?

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.760
Is there a detective you know
at a Busan police station?

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.450
I'm not sure. I came to Seoul a long time ago.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.800
Why? Did something happen?

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.630
She was interested in a detective there.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.280
I know it was forever ago, but still.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.910
Hey, listen to you. I was never
interested in a detective.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.040
Oh, my. Was it the youngest detective there?

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.580
He was totally your type.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.100
Not at all.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.920
I swear he wasn't. Not at all.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.550
He wasn't, then. No need to overemphasize.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.740
She means he wasn't really.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.190
Be honest. If he asked you out,

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.870
you would've dated him.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.420
I was so successful back then.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.370
Why would I date a lowly detective? Are you crazy?

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.800
Gosh, seriously.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.840
He had a terrible style,

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.290
and his face was dirty,
as if he hadn't washed himself.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.550
Dirty?

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.380
That's how dark he was.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.410
That's not all.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.180
He sounded like a country
bumpkin whenever he spoke.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.110
Gosh. Oh, my gosh!

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.370
How could Im Se Ra, the goddess of Korea

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:23.600
date someone like him unless she went crazy?

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.420
- Don't you think?
- Yes.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.930
Of course. I'm sure.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.250
He really was the worst, okay?

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.190
I guess you don't think...

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:39.620
that detective might have disliked you.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.840
Right.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.670
You need to respect his opinion, too.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.790
We were obviously on different levels.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.730
Why would he say no to her?

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.590
He must've had his own taste, too.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:57.530
I defy all taste, okay?

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.810
I did back then.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.700
I wouldn't have liked you if I were him, too.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.090
That's how I would've felt then.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.590
You two make a great couple.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.000
What are you saying? Get in.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.830
Unni, we need to have a second round.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.590
- We need to sing a duet, you and I.
- Get in.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.630
♫ Don't hurt anyone like this again ♫

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.060
♫ Hurting me was enough ♫

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.160
- We're leaving now.
- Okay.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.630
Unni!

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.530
Unni!

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.340
Let's go.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.040
Whatever.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.180
Get in from the other side.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.680
Gu Nam Ju was so handsome back then.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.450
Whoa, time is cruel.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.090
Aigoo...

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.560
Gosh, that's where that precious stuff was. Gosh.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.360
It was under my butt.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.740
There's no difference once you digest.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.700
Do you want it? Should we split it?

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.280
No, thank you.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.000
Suit yourself.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.210
You have such a strong stomach.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.460
Why did you dislike Im Se Ra, then?

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.160
I have a strong stomach,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.120
but I'm not nice enough to cater to the goddess.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.210
Gosh. You smell.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:47.760
Talk facing that way.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.080
What? Why?

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.690
Gosh. What are you doing?

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.400
Seriously.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.050
By the way,

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.610
is Tae Suk a trustworthy person?

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.040
Of course. We're basically sisters.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.440
I understand she couldn't be
in touch for a long time.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.630
It must've been hard for her to make a living, too.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.770
Don't trust anyone yet.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.050
Are you suspicious of her, by chance?

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.680
No matter how close you are,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.970
don't trust anyone until you get your memory back.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.380
Anyone could be a culprit.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.280
What were you trying to say earlier?

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.240
I'll tell you later.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.670
You must've come to the set
because it was important.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.510
What is it? Huh?

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.770
You were supposed to send me

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.790
the witness info. But I haven't heard.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.330
I called them since I couldn't reach them.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.990
It turns out they used a burner phone.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.990
If I leave now, it'd really be over.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.960
I'll tell you when the situation improves.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:24.920
What were you trying to say earlier?

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.580
I'll tell you later.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.370
I'll tell you when the situation improves.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.300
What was he going to say?

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.670
I'm dying to know.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.490
Stop, stop, stop!

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.910
You need to cut all carrots, potatoes, and onions.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.320
But you only cut carrots.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.990
I guess I was too focused.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.070
Is your mind skipping since you skipped a few days?

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.190
Well...

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.580
I was meaning to tell you.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.270
I'll quit at the end of the month.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:08.370
Are you doing this because
you cut a lot of carrots?

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:13.060
Gosh, no. It's not because of the carrots.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.360
I got to start a different job.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.380
- A different job? What job?
- What job?

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.840
- Where are you going?
- What are you doing?

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.500
I'm sorry.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.410
Not suddenly showing up like last time

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.470
would inconvenience you too much.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:32.180
I want to use this opportunity
to do what I really want to do.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.670
Gosh, congrats.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.190
You should just stay here.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.810
It's hard to find work as good.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.420
- I know.
- Where are you going?

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:50.000
I was wondering what you've been doing.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.800
- And you've been chasing after a celebrity?
- Give me that.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.560
Hey, are you stalking celebs now?

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.400
I'm not stalking. I'm investigating.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.200
It'd be better if you stalked.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.170
A traffic cop should issue tickets.
Why are you investigating?

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.660
Get me a coffee if you're free.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.090
Okay.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.080
If he's been after her for 25 years,

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.110
it's likely someone near her.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.060
Go back to the beginning.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.090
Rewind back to before these cars appeared.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.230
Text it to me, please.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:54.520
All the videos from a week ago to now.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:59.470
Could I have a look at the CCTV footage here?

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.410
It hasn't been saving footage for a while.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.060
Oh, really?

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.290
Could I check the CCTV?

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.120
Looking great now.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.830
So pretty.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.930
I love it.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.840
Okay, thank you!

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.150
You're the best!

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.110
You're the best! The best!

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.670
She's the country's best.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.590
- She's the best.
- Thank you.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.750
- Great!
- Director!

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.820
Tell CEO Kang not to schedule
magazine shoots anymore.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.720
It's so hard to be on a diet for it.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.650
Printed ads pay better, at least.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.380
But the editorials immortalize your beauty.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.400
Tell him to only book commercials
or editorials abroad.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.800
I'll push the mysterious image.
Tell him to stop exposing me.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.870
You have a meeting with an environmental
docu producer tomorrow.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.660
Cancel it.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.320
Right. Did you tell him about the interior design?

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.850
I said I'll get the interior done.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.730
Get a sponsor, I said.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.890
She says she'll never reveal her
home to stay mysterious.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:12.160
And to push the Cannes image, she wants to

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.900
shoot in Paris for the next editorial.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.950
- She asked for a private jet.
- Hey, bastard.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.870
Can't you stop it in the middle?

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.870
A private jet? Private jet, my foot.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:23.110
CEO Kang,

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:26.420
please sign this. It's urgent.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.590
She said it's her reward
for boosting your new artists.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:35.570
She benefited from another artist
when she was new, too.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.330
What should we do with the environment docu?

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.450
She always posts about protecting
the earth on social media.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.090
She can't just bail now.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:46.060
What should I do? Huh? Huh?

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.500
I know. What should we do?

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.500
Geez...

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.160
[Jewelry Shop Girl]

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.300
You're the lead. Go Hui Yeong
is a supporting character.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.760
You didn't tell me on purpose,
so I don't reject it.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.540
Noona, Noona!

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.570
Im Se Ra wasn't this bad.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.810
I'll contact the documentary director.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.160
Go.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.670
Okay.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.170
See you.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.780
If you submitted your parents' consent form,

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.890
you're Two One Entertainment's
trainee starting today.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.110
Watch your behavior in public.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:30.060
I told you, didn't I?

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.570
You can't start the training

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.040
If they're abroad, don't you have a relative here?

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.460
Well, I do have an aunt.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.190
- Are you related?
- Yes.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.340
Get it from her, then.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.870
There's an attendance check soon.

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.420
Today's confirmation code is 4829.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.110
4829.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.790
Enter it in five minutes
to prove your attendance, okay?

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.050
Okay.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.430
Yes. That's right.

Ma'am.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.050
Let go.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.660
Let go of me.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:34.630
Let go, I said!

- Yes?

"Serve yourself pickled radish."

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.130
S-Stay there. I'll get it for you.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.710
What do you think? Don't you
look a lot younger now?

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:59.310
I sharpened your jawline by shading it.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.760
If things go well, I'll pay you
back for the makeup.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.750
You're not. Why would you say that?

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.190
You know how much guilt I have toward you.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.440
Guilt?

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.700
Well...

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.420
back when I was a nobody, you hired me

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.510
and you let me grow like this.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.430
I came this far, thanks to you.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:31.440
You're right. You were such a baby then.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.990
You grew so much, and you're caring for me now.

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.230
Unni, you'll get right back up, too.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.860
Much more fabulous than before. You know, right?

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:48.510
I'll really make things work this time.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.080
Taking me off the show out of the blue?

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.640
Worked out that way.
You don't have to come anymore.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.220
E-Excuse me,

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:06.400
the director liked my acting, though.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.100
- I delivered the news, okay?
- But...

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.250
I quit my job, too.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.010
I heard you got fired.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.800
Why did you have to be hated by the lead?

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.670
Can't you tell who to tiptoe around on set?

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:36.290
By chance,

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.090
did I get fired because of her?

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.130
You lost your hunch along with your memory?

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.190
Why did you have to stick out? Why would you-

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.740
Are you sure? Is that the reason?

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.130
Why? Will you flip out on her or something?

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.630
I can't just disappear like this.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.490
I didn't get fired because I couldn't act.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:57.230
I can't leave for an unjust reason like that.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.510
I'll never quit.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:11.020
Yes, I'm Bong Cheong Ja, who played

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.220
the housekeeper in this drama.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.490
Would I be able to talk to the writer?

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:19.520
She's busy writing. Talk to me instead.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.390
Well, it's too sensitive a subject
to discuss on the phone.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.710
Text her, then.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:27.370
Hello...

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.490
Geez, why is she so rude?

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.670
Why is it so hard to meet the writer?

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:40.550
They used to beg to see me in the past.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:50.680
You got fired? What do you mean?

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.540

Writer Chu's office is No. 1801 at Lake Officetel.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.970
Don't go empty-handed.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.500
Make sure you settle this.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.200
We killed him a long time ago.
What do you want to do now?

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:37.160
We already buried the body.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.060
Did I suggest killing him?

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:43.710
Since we killed someone,

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.770
I wanted to disguise it as an accident.

I won't care anymore, either.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.140

I swear. I swear.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.360
I didn't hear anything.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.780
That phone call just now was...

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.300
No, no! Don't come!

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.910
No, no! Don't come! No!

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:50.650
I'm so sorry.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.460
I did a terrible thing, not knowing
you were the writer.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.860
Sit comfortably.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.250
You don't have to kneel for me.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.740
I saw you acting, Ms. Bong.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.760
I have a long way to go, don't I?

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.240
I liked it.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:19.680
The director actually liked it on set, too.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.540
I was already feeling bad about it.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:27.630
To be honest, you got fired because of me.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.840
What do you mean...

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.520
I fixed the script.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.940
I made the housekeeper role bigger.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.390
Ms. Han flipped out after she found out.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.080
Hearing the explanation,

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.620
I feel even worse. I'm sorry.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.370
You shouldn't be sorry.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.840
The one who should be sorry

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.390
is the broadcasting studio for
always demanding a ridiculous plot.

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:00.730
Should I pour you just one glass?

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:12.720
The story plot is already
ridiculous all over the place.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.520
A cheating husband,

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.150
a piece-of-work wife,

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:18.710
murder, and revenge.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:23.200
What more could I possibly do?

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:29.470
Rather than bringing a dead person back,

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:34.340
wouldn't it be better to
strengthen a new character?

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.390
A new character?

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:39.820
It wasn't just the husband who was cheating.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.960
The wife who acted superior was cheating, too.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.790
Ms. Han was?

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:49.490
Gosh. Two-way cheating isn't
even considered ridiculous.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.150
It's not just two-way cheating.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:55.000
It turns out...

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.840
the housekeeper...

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:02.140
was the husband and mistress's
illegitimate daughter.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:06.490
She entered the house in disguise
to take revenge on the wife.

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:10.590
Isn't the housekeeper too old for that?

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.470
Drawing a birthmark turns you into someone else.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:15.440
Getting plastic surgery is no issue.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.890
She made herself look old and ugly on purpose.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.440
She got plastic surgery.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.750
Wouldn't they say I'm taking it too far?

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.180
That's what makes it ridiculous.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.440
What's this? A secret lover?

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.750
It's better than playing acoustic guitar.

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:33.970
You owe me.

Director Ju,

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:41.860
the synopsis didn't mention this.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.930
How could you suddenly change the plot?

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:45.900
The story changes as you shoot.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.850
Changes in plot are common.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.780
And I thought you were firing that woman.

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.200
Why is she back here?

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.450
It'd be weird if she suddenly disappeared.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.060
We're probably just making a transition.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.090
So annoying.

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.940

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.280
Ready, action.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:18.160
What's your relationship with the madam?

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.560
You're framing an innocent person.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.420
What relationship do you mean?

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.710
I can find out by checking your dashcam.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.500
Are you crazy?

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.930
- Let go!
- You aren't...

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.130
Cut!

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.920
Are you okay?

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.190
Gosh, sorry. I couldn't control my strength.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.640
Yes, I'm okay.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.170
The new script turned out very well.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.400
It's so dynamic that it's jumping up and down.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.810
Yes, the visuals feel good.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:56.100
Should I be rougher in the next scene?

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.400
Huh?

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.050
Yes, it's okay.

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:04.210
My body isn't important. It's all about the drama.

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.850
Let go!

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:15.990
Did you come here to take revenge on the madam?

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:17.430
Why did you come to this house?

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:18.910
It doesn't matter!

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.800
Because I'm destined to...

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.310
die, anyway.

♫ The growing wave, and how radiant you are ♫

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:46.880
♫ You must be a witch ♫

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.710
♫ I'll revive it ♫

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:52.840
I'll take you to the questioning room.

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.650
She's so pretty, isn't she?

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:05.800
Yes.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.510
Pardon?

00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:11.610
Well, I'm not so sure.

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.950
Is that considered pretty?

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:16.130
Something's wrong with your eyes.

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:19.430
Hey. Watch where you're going.

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:21.040
Okay.

00:58:52.700 --> 00:59:00.340
♫ The passing sound of waves ♫

00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:06.630
♫ Typhoons that are on my way in this moment ♫

00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:09.840
You're so successful. Why did you
ignore me all this time?

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.670
How could I find someone who's determined to hide?

00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:14.700
I'm not even a cop.

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:18.700
What are you up to, dragging Im Se Ra in?

00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:21.170
The world you're trying to return to.

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:23.600
The culprit is in there.

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.630
We promised to meet then.

00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:27.650
I was going to pay the settlement.

00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:30.310
Just shut up and watch.

00:59:30.310 --> 00:59:34.200
You mean, the car accident wasn't by chance, right?
