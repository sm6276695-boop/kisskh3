[Episode 21]

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.170
[General's Residence]

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.340
It's so spicy.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.380
Do people here
all like such strong liquor?

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.960
The air here is damp,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.100
so the liquor naturally
has more kick to it.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.490
Of course, it can't compare

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.610
to the fine wines of Wuling Mountain.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.360
Senior.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.470
I was expelled
from Wuling Mountain long ago.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.750
I don't deserve

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.450
to be called your senior anymore.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.210
Come,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.800
Senior,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.370
have a seat.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.930
Alright,

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.970
you sit too.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.470
Here.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.910
Thank you.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.830
How is Godfather doing these days?

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.790
The old man…

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.500
has passed away.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.690
Six months after you left,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.560
one day,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.280
he went into the forbidden area
to refine medicine.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.810
He was gone for several days

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.400
and still didn't return.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.460
When we finally found him,

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.590
he had already been murdered.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.970
Have you found out who did it?

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.910
This was found near his body.

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.120
Apart from this,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.050
there are no other clues.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.630
I never thought

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.550
that after I was expelled from the sect

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.670
for practicing forbidden techniques,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.760
I'd never see him again.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.970
Senior,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.600
why have you come to Lucheng?

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.120
And how did you know
I was at the General's Residence

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.090
to invite me

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.050
to meet you here?

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.930
Let me ask you first—

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.430
where is Jade Linglong now?

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.950
How do you…

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.760
know about that?

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.310
I've long heard
that Lucheng has a man in black

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.040
who can fight
against 10,000 soldiers alone.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.560
Such power,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.950
I believe,

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.190
must be related to the sacred
Jade Linglong from the mountain.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.190
But Wuling Mountain

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.120
has always stayed out of worldly affairs.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.030
Why would it serve in the army?

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.000
So I came to investigate

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.350
and quickly discovered

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.390
that this man in black

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.240
is actually a shadow puppet
created by Jade Linglong

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.040
and is hiding
within the General's Residence.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.720
Am I right?

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.850
Senior, your analysis is spot on.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.960
Actually, on the day Godfather was killed,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.560
Jade Linglong went missing
from the mountain.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.930
I led our people to search everywhere,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.550
but there was no trace of it.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.780
Only recently

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.720
did I finally track it here.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.390
I didn't expect you

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.300
to be better informed than me.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.120
The shadow puppet

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.680
created by Jade Linglong

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.140
will surely bring disaster to the world.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.880
Although I've been expelled from the sect,

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.750
I still owe it a debt of gratitude.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I thought

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.730
if I could return Jade Linglong

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.190
before it caused chaos,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.000
perhaps Godfather might forgive me

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.240
and allow me to serve by his side again.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.180
I never expected that he was already…

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.390
Since you know so much,

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.920
you must have been lurking in Lucheng
for quite some time.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.950
What progress have you made?

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.740
That shadow puppet is extremely powerful.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.740
I set traps again and again,

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.500
but he easily escaped each time

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.409
and even injured me.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.650
I know that with my strength alone,

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.580
it'll be difficult to subdue him.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.750
Fortunately, you appeared in time.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.800
If we work together,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.770
-we will…
-If we work together?

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.490
Wouldn't that mean
pushing him to his death?

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.800
That shadow puppet hasn't fully merged
with Jade Linglong yet.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.530
If he loses his mind,

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.130
his chaotic power will be devastating.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.920
If we don't take him out now,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.560
he'll definitely become a greater threat
in the future.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.170
I've already met this person.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.880
Though he shows signs of losing control,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.280
he isn't beyond control.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.920
The situation

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.920
hasn't reached that point yet.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.560
We are both healers.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.910
How can we carelessly take someone's life?

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.170
You're just the same as back then.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.320
You haven't changed at all.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.610
Fine.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.390
Let's

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.480
think this through.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.620
Li,

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.240
is Zhang San's son

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.920
going to get married?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.560
Yeah.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.020
The bride is quite pretty.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.160
Sir,

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.560
mind stepping aside?

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.800
You're blocking the way.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.270
Sir!

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.000
Murder! Murder!

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.870
The man in black killed someone!

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.050
The man in black killed someone!

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.040
Help! The man in black killed someone!

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.770
Master,

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.620
everything is done.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.040
Once dawn breaks,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.450
news that the man in black
slaughtered civilians

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.549
will spread throughout the city.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.480
Very good.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.870
Now let's see

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.600
how my compassionate junior

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.150
will react to this.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.870
[General's Residence]

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.750
I thought you were some reclusive master.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.510
Turns out—

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.270
you're actually a despicable scoundrel

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.550
who attacks from behind.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.200
You dare to talk back?

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.390
Several murders have occurred in the city,

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.630
with extremely brutal killing methods.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.390
A survivor saw with his own eyes

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.130
that the man in black did it.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.550
Black armor, masked face,
defeating the Yao Army—

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.880
isn't that exactly you?

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:29.120
After committing such brutal crimes,

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.350
what do you have to say for yourself?

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.440
I didn't kill those people.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.750
You still try to deny it?

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.680
I told you before

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.120
that shadow puppets can lose control

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.050
and become totally unreasonable.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.630
Who knows if you were
sleepwalking at night

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.630
and killing people unconsciously?

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.010
The same mask

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.810
can be bought anywhere.

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.600
Besides,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.120
I've been at the General's Residence
day and night.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.650
Everyone can testify to it.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.030
You, on the other hand,

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.490
have been skulking about.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.410
I suspect you're the one
plotting behind the scenes,

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:57.770
trying to frame me.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.080
We of Wuling Mountain act
with honor and integrity.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.360
I'd never stoop so low.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.040
Since you didn't witness it yourself,

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.870
how can you be certain

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.170
that I'm not being framed?

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.510
Enough talk.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.590
Come back to Wuling Mountain with me.

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.870
Be good,

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.240
and come back to Wuling Mountain with me.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.740
Why didn't you kill me?

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.080
You think one small favor

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.110
will clear you of suspicion?

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.390
Believe what you want,

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.530
but remember this:

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.120
this matter

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.000
stays between us.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.990
It concerns no one else.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.320
Watch me closely,

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.220
and see if I'll become

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.110
the cruel, ruthless monster
you claim I'll be.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.670
If you disregard human lives

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.290
for your own selfish desires,

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.990
I won't let you off either.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.270
He could've taken my life

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.790
but held his hand.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.110
He really doesn't seem like the type
to kill innocents.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.600
Could it be

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.750
it really wasn't him?

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.610
Then who could it be?

00:11:58.950 --> 00:11:59.700
No.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.460
I can't just take his word for it.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:03.550
If the situation gets out of control,

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.880
the consequences would be unimaginable.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.320
It seems

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.910
the Kongqing Water is still necessary.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.240
Better safe than sorry.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.470
Good thing my fan is fine.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.700
Shuang is still in danger.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:31.890
I can't abandon her.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.150
Don't you understand?

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.830
Right now, for her,

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:37.510
you are the greatest danger.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.390
Don't worry.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.040
You won't lose me that easily.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.320
Actually,

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.750
I cherish my life

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.030
more than anyone else does.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.840
The Emperor is incompetent,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.100
and Prince Li is cruel.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.290
Neither is fit to rule the country.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.510
But the Crown Prince is different.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.400
He is benevolent

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.400
and magnanimous.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.210
If we do our best to protect him,

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.030
perhaps Taijin

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.130
will still have a glimmer of hope.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.600
And the common people

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.000
might live better lives.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.360
Shuang, don't worry.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.200
No matter what,

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.630
I'll make sure your wish comes true.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:29.360
This…

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.650
What's going on?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.200
His Highness said

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.260
he has no appetite.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.360
Prince Li just came
to throw his weight around,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.190
and now Your Highness can't even eat?

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.050
If things get worse in the future,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.400
what will you do then?

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.230
Besides enduring it,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.750
what else can I do?

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.790
My mother was of humble origins.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.990
Prince Li has never seen me as a brother.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.890
After Father named me heir,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.120
he only saw me as a thorn in his side,

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.840
eager to get rid of me.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.320
Though I bear

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.270
the title of Crown Prince,

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.360
my hands are tied.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.390
Who knows?

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.670
I might even lose my life one day.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.550
You play go?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.550
That was a brilliant move.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:53.480
It broke the deadlock

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.480
I'd struggled with for days.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.390
Perhaps

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.320
Your Highness's go skills
are just terrible.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.360
Or perhaps

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.710
Your Highness has trapped yourself.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:14.190
Your resentment shows

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.120
your heart's still alive.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.850
But unfortunately,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.980
all you do is wallow in self-pity.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.160
How do you know

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.890
you don't have a winning move?

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.800
Prince Li targets you at every turn

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.220
only because you're the obstacle
on his path to the throne.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:35.530
No matter how you try to avoid him,

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.800
he won't let you go.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.350
Constantly giving in

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.480
will only leave you
with fewer and fewer options.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.330
Since being the Crown Prince
can't keep Prince Li in check,

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.660
have you ever thought of

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.170
taking the throne?

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.100
Though I'm heir to the throne,

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.590
I'm never dead-set

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:09.550
on ascending the throne.

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.330
If you don't fight,

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.750
someone will surely find a way
to eliminate you.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.790
Your Highness holds a high position

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.070
but not much power,

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.730
which makes you a perfect target.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.700
Prince Li dares to push you around now.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.900
If he truly ascends the throne one day,

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:27.990
your situation

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.600
will only be

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.320
more humiliating

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.890
and more miserable than it is now.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.750
Do you realize

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.370
the consequences of such treasonous words?

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.240
I'm merely speaking the truth.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.000
As the Crown Prince,

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.820
you're the rightful heir.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.880
Building your strength

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:53.450
to counter Prince Li

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:54.720
is both your duty

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.100
and your right.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.270
But now you're being trampled underfoot

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.270
like mud.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.130
Do you really want

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.450
to be bullied like this your whole life?

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.060
Living like your right hand,

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.579
never seeing the light of day.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.500
Prince Li's influence at court runs deep.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.599
He carries a lot of clout.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.599
How can I possibly compete with him?

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160
If I fail,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.500
do you have any idea

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.270
what price I'll pay?

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.079
By yourself,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.619
perhaps you can't make it.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:27.160
But…

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.270
I can be your ally.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:34.880
Who…

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.680
exactly are you?

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.160
The man

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.350
in

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:41.650
black.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.920
Yin,

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.070
the Kongqing Water

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:56.280
can only be refined through both orthodox
and unorthodox techniques.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:57.960
It is the only thing

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.110
in this world

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.930
that can counter Jade Linglong.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.790
Today, you and I are joining forces.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.070
It feels like

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.680
it's predestined.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:11.310
Senior,

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.200
though you can use
forbidden techniques,

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.310
there's no guarantee of success.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.240
After we activate this furnace together,

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.880
if anything unusual happens,

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.340
we must stop immediately.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.350
Alright.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.830
Though refining the Kongqing Water
is dangerous,

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.950
to suppress the power of Jade Linglong,

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.200
you and I

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.960
must take this risk.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.160
After the elixir is initially formed,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.590
I'll need to refine it for 49 more days.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.150
Then,

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.720
I'll give the Kongqing Water to you.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.190
I hope you'll use it wisely.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.030
Your Highness,

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.090
haven't you already guessed it?

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.800
You just admitted it like that?

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.480
Aren't you afraid I'll…

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.280
You won't.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.070
The man in black

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:19.180
is a powerful ally.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.530
Your Highness has already
reached a dead end.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.160
You can't refuse me.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.850
Nothing escapes your eyes.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.330
When people lose their rationality,

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.740
it's hard to control their instincts.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.400
But you've already done well,

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.350
hiding your edge to survive.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.640
Not too foolish.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.040
Why do you want to help me?

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.520
Prince Li is cruel by nature.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.030
If the country

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.830
fell into his hands,

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.530
it'd surely become a living hell.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.100
Shuang

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:29.480
named me Jin'an

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.920
with the hope

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.790
that Taijin would enjoy
lasting peace and prosperity.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.280
This is her lifelong wish.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:41.680
Now it seems

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:43.570
you're the only one

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.340
who can fulfill her wish.

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:04.450
What should I do?

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.920
His Highness had men bring these gifts

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.680
from Lucheng

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.990
especially for Your Highness.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.470
His Highness cares so much for you.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.150
Worthless junk.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.060
Take them away.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:28.860
Wait.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.930
His Highness is so thoughtful,

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.010
sending a letter to me from so far away.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.620
I heard he was attacked not long ago.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.210
Is everything alright now?

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.360
Rest assured, Prime Minister.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.040
With General Li's protection in Lucheng,

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.700
His Highness is safe and well.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.880
However...

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.180
Speak freely.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.690
Since Prince Li arrived in Lucheng,

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.800
he has been making things hard
for His Highness.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.690
Though General Li wishes to mediate,

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.000
she doesn't dare to intervene

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.920
because Prince Li is too powerful.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.670
Not only was the attack brushed aside,

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.790
but His Highness was publicly humiliated.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:21.720
Had we known,

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.010
it would've been better to stay in Yunjing

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.610
than suffer such indignity.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.110
I've spoken out of turn.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:29.650
Please forgive me, Prime Minister.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.170
Is that

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.400
what you think,

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.160
or what His Highness thinks?

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.750
His Highness

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.120
never said it outright,

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.610
but in private, he often misses Yunjing.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.110
His Highness also told me

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.480
that despite being the Crown Prince,

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.960
he's often disrespected.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.260
In this world, the only one he can rely on

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.060
is you, Prime Minister.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.720
Looks like His Highness
has learned something

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.270
during his trip to Lucheng.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.790
Go back and tell him

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.680
I've seen his improvement.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.040
As for the matters
mentioned in the letter,

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.950
I'll handle them all properly.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:07.320
Thank you, Prime Minister.

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.750
Recently,

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.750
news has come from Yunjing.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:19.720
The steward of Tian Huailiang,
a director in the Ministry of Personnel,

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.830
and the sedan bearer of Zhao Qingsong
from the Ministry of Rites

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.560
quarreled in the marketplace.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.970
It even escalated into a public brawl,

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.550
alarming the authorities.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.600
Both Tian Huailiang and Zhao Qingsong

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.920
work for Prince Li.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.640
After this happened,

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.480
many people had a good laugh.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.240
These people side with Prince Li

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.750
for profit alone.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.780
Unfortunately,

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.790
too little meat for too many wolves.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:43.300
When the spoils aren't divided equally,

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.560
rifts are inevitable.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.470
Officials need to keep up appearances,

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:48.590
but their servants,

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.070
with just a bit of goading,

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.660
lose their composure.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.960
It's a pity

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:55.970
that after just a few days,

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.110
the two of them

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.510
made peace in person.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.220
But it makes sense.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.750
They've been allies for years.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.000
Their ties run deep.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.080
How could a minor attempt to sow discord

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.860
turn them against each other?

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:10.830
No rush.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.550
Plant a few more seeds

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:14.440
of discord in their hearts.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.240
When the time comes,

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.000
their alliance can collapse

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.350
in an instant.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.600
Every weakness of your enemy

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.060
is an opportunity for you.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.240
By the way,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.550
your father-in-law, the Prime Minister,

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.790
truly values you.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.420
All these matters were
handled efficiently.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.620
Perhaps before long,

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.830
you'll be able to rise with this momentum

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.160
and rival Prince Li.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.880
But I still don't quite understand.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:40.680
How could just a few letters

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.310
make Ji Lan trust me?

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.180
Who said he trusts you?

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:49.570
The Emperor has only two sons.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:51.920
The Prime Minister's daughter married you.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.850
He has no choice.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.110
But you—

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.270
you wallowed in the past,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.740
being hot and cold with the Ji family.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.810
You almost missed this winning move.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.340
If you show willingness to work with them

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.760
and demonstrate
that you share their interests,

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.070
they'll feel more secure

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:08.160
and place their bets

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.440
on you.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.030
So,

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.550
you want me to please Ji Tianjiao

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.680
as a way

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:17.830
to win favor with both her and her father

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:18.830
and show loyalty?

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.970
A crown prince who can be manipulated

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.070
is hard to resist.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.070
Moreover, in their eyes,

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:27.070
what matters most

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.120
is your title as heir.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.930
If you use this to your advantage,

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.830
you'll have

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.560
a greater chance of success.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.020
The more I tie myself to the Ji family,

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.880
the further I drift from Shuang.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.790
That is

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.530
part of your plan too, isn't it?

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.530
You've seen through me.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.230
I'm just an ordinary man, not a sage.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.160
Since I'm helping you,

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.270
I should get something out of it.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.440
You're quite frank.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.440
If I had met you sooner,

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.350
perhaps

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:04.400
we could have been friends.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.590
Since we're friends,

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.030
Your Highness,

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:11.360
will you give me a handicap?

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.310
You just agreed?

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.720
The royals know no mercy.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.340
Remember this:

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.760
once a wolf has its prey in its jaws,

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.130
it never lets go easily.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.750
Your every act of mercy

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:30.010
will only be repaid
with your enemy's cruelty.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.100
Your Highness.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.810
What were you thinking?

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.070
Why did you bring His Highness out here?

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:49.650
It's not his fault.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.750
I was feeling bored in the residence

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.720
and asked him to accompany me for a walk.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.240
I see.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.340
It was my oversight.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.000
I'm getting tired.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.400
I'll go back and rest.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.270
Since you have some free time today,

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:03.790
Jin'an,

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.200
keep General Li

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.960
company for me.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:12.490
Farewell, Your Highness.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.720
His Highness is so kind,

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.510
giving me time off to accompany you.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.680
Though it's partly

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.680
to show goodwill,

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:20.490
I still

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.070
appreciate it.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.540
Prince Li is watching like a hawk,

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.550
yet you don't seem to care at all.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:28.920
You're scolding me.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.430
You're scolding me.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.800
Though you're scolding me,

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.060
what I feel more than anything

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:37.530
is your concern for me.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.350
So frivolous.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.790
You really are asking for a beating.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.440
It hurts.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:48.730
Scoundrel.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.040
Why are you staring at me?

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.640
Is there something wrong

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.750
with my face?

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.180
I want to remember you.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.650
I want to imprint you in my mind.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.300
I want to paint your portrait.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.680
That way,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.790
I won't have to fear forgetting you.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:19.590
Forget me?

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.260
Why would you forget me?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.050
I've already forgotten many people.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.510
All my memories of the past

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.400
are gone.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.600
Sometimes, I suddenly fear

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.150
that I'll forget you too.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.870
If that day ever comes,

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.230
it'd mean you're heartless.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.440
When that happens,

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.100
no matter how far away you are,

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.590
I'll find you.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.070
It's a deal.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:23.640
It's a deal.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.080
How are Tian Huailiang
and Zhao Qingsong these days?

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.940
Both men have served
as officials for years.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.070
They know what to do.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.360
They're important court officials,

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.050
yet over a few servants,

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:44.620
they've caused such a stir.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.160
Troublesome fools.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.910
But I think

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.480
these two officials may have

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.810
some friction in court,

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.930
but why did this happen precisely

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:56.570
when Your Highness left the capital?

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:57.640
I'm afraid

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.200
someone has been
plotting behind the scenes.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:01.570
Who do you suspect?

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:02.720
There are few in court

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:05.180
bold enough to oppose Your Highness.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.480
The Li family

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.000
tops the list.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.590
Your Highness,

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.830
could it have been the Crown Prince?

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:19.960
It doesn't seem like his doing.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.750
You're right, Your Highness.

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.750
However,

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.790
even if the Crown Prince didn't order it,

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.570
it's possible that he sees this

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.910
as an opportunity

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.270
to turn the tables.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.020
Your Highness,

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:36.240
you should stay cautious.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.070
Yes, I must be cautious.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.220
The day of the ritual draws near.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.350
It's time to observe their movements.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.650
If the right opportunity arises,

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.650
we'll take the Crown Prince's life.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.030
General,

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.380
Prince Li's men are here.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.920
Greetings, General.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.030
What brings you here, Steward Bao?

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.350
I'm here with a message from Prince Li.

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.480
The weather has been excellent lately,

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.070
perfect for hunting.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.750
Surely the borderlands here

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:24.790
have beasts

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.390
that are rare in the capital.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:28.360
Prince Li invites the Crown Prince

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.160
to go hunting

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.230
tomorrow.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.310
His Highness is in such a good mood.

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:36.000
But the Crown Prince is still recovering.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.330
-I'm afraid…
-General.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.680
Prince Li has made up his mind.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.630
If the Crown Prince is

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.020
willing to go, fine.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:43.640
If not,

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:45.680
he has to force himself to go.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:47.570
Besides, with his weak constitution,

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:48.980
he should get more sun

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.270
and exercise more

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.790
to strengthen his body.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.060
I'll take my leave.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.200
Oh, by the way,

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:57.730
General,

00:31:58.790 --> 00:31:59.550
if you're

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.410
free tomorrow,

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.010
you're welcome to join us.

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:03.160
You too.

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.520
The Crown Prince is truly unfortunate

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.890
to have such a brother.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.040
He can't live a single day in peace.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.260
Your Highness!

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.070
Muyang,

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.700
I was shooting a lame deer.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.530
I also want to see

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.550
what you'll catch today.

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:47.980
There are no animal sounds nearby.

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:49.830
It seems this hunt of Prince Li's

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.030
has another purpose.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:53.870
Protect His Highness.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:08.960
Stop.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:53.750
Behind us!

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.100
Your Highness.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.440
Li Shuang,

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.280
how dare you?

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.550
You're holding Prince Li hostage.

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.550
Don't you fear the execution
of your entire family?

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.750
As expected of the General of the North.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.210
I truly admire you.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.110
If you and the Changfeng Army

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:19.600
are willing to follow me

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.940
and help me secure the throne,

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:22.880
I'll give you

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.840
a high position in the future.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.280
The Crown Prince is the legitimate heir,

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.070
the only successor to the throne.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:30.530
When was it ever your turn?

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.580
The Changfeng Army is loyal and righteous.

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.639
How could we conspire with traitors?

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:36.739
At this point,

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.870
are you still going to back down?

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.070
Stand up.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:43.639
You're a prince.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.520
Only by standing tall

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.409
will you not be trampled on.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:48.870
You're the Crown Prince,

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.320
but now you're being trampled underfoot

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.320
like mud.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.320
Do you really want

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:56.050
to be bullied like this your whole life?

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.000
I am the Crown Prince.

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:02.930
How dare you rebel against me?

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.820
Su Muli,

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.710
you have repeatedly

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:11.280
defied the Crown Prince.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.790
That's already terrible disrespect.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.790
And now, under the guise of hunting,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.540
you plot to assassinate His Highness.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.670
Isn't this treason?

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.110
It's a misunderstanding, Your Highness.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.240
The borderland

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.420
is full of bandits.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:26.730
The assassination

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:28.510
was truly a misunderstanding.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.590
After I return,

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.530
I will thoroughly investigate

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.790
and give Your Highness an explanation.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.690
What does Prince Li think?

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:47.480
I…

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.920
I was careless

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:52.690
and offended Your Highness.

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:53.810
Please forgive me.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:56.790
You're my brother,

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.840
so I'll let it go today.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.280
But remember:

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.800
whether you accept it or not,

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.760
I'm the only Crown Prince of Taijin.

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:12.040
Let's go.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.730
[General's Residence]

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.070
Freshly made ginseng chicken soup.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:31.600
Have some

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:32.800
to calm your nerves.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:36.840
How did you

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.320
feel today?

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.880
When I saw Prince Li's eyes,

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.740
I felt as if I'd fallen
into a frozen cave.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.280
But…

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.230
I haven't felt so free in a long time.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:54.410
It's just that…

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:57.510
to him,

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.950
I'm nothing but a lowly person.

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:03.800
If I dare resist,

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:06.210
it means falling out with him.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:07.760
The days ahead

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.160
will only get harder.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:10.830
No matter what you do,

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.190
he won't let you off.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.110
Rather than thinking about

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:15.400
how to please him,

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:16.800
you should consider

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.720
how to plan for yourself.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:20.590
Today at the hunt,

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.150
you didn't expose
those assassins' identities,

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.950
which already let him save face.

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.630
Besides,

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:28.860
you carried yourself as the Crown Prince,

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.560
making him wary of crossing you.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:31.850
You've done very well.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.880
Really?

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.190
But today

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.190
you also offended Prince Li.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.760
He'll never let it go.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.510
That's

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.170
not for you to worry about.

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:47.310
Drink your soup

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:48.410
and get some rest.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:08.140
Your Highness,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:09.800
it's late.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.030
You should get some rest.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:12.560
Su Muyang is so despicable!

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.960
He actually used the title of Crown Prince

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.890
he stole from me
to lord it over me.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.880
And Li Shuang—

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:18.440
she openly defied me

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.840
and protected Su Muyang.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.040
The Crown Prince

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:22.960
holds an empty title

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.130
with no real power.

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:25.800
He barked so loudly today

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.400
only because he had backing.

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:30.340
But Li Shuang truly commands an army.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:32.610
If she really joins hands
with the Crown Prince,

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:34.740
it'll be even harder to deal with him.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.810
I hoped Li Shuang

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.150
could read the situation
and pick the right side.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.470
Since Su Muyang

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.510
dared to lord it over me,

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.390
he shouldn't blame me
for what happens next.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:49.530
Your Highness,

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.390
I've heard something.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:52.510
In this city,

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.030
there's a Sixu Clinic.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:55.920
Its female owner, surnamed Lu,

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.230
is a close friend of Li Shuang.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.510
Since they like meddling so much,

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:01.570
let's give them

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.580
more than enough to meddle in.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.000
Fire! Someone help!

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.590
Put out the fire!

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:16.320
Hurry up!

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:16.920
Fire!

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:17.670
Help!

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:18.840
Fire!

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.630
Someone help!

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.140
Boss, you've worked hard.

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:35.480
Have some tea.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.250
Nanxing,

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.340
did something go sour in the kitchen?

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.840
Boss,

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.230
your daily Five-Animal Exercises

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.960
really came in handy.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:43.890
That's amazing.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:54.320
Lu Xin.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.000
Thank goodness you're fine.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.440
I lost the clinic,

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.000
and I lost Nanxing too.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.360
How did you get so badly hurt?

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.170
I brought Mo Yin with me.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.100
He'll treat you in a moment.

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:54.160
-What are you doing?
-How dare you!

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:54.820
Step aside!

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:03.400
Here is the imperial dagger.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.400
You guys,

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:06.890
hand over the Crown Prince immediately!

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.400
Go inform General Li.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:10.070
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.260
Your Highness.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.660
Your Highness,

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.880
no matter what happens,

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.630
don't go out.

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.550
Prince Li has come
while General Li is away

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.550
and even brought the imperial dagger.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.480
Your Highness should hide for now.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.300
The imperial dagger?

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:43.710
How is that possible?

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.850
That's Father's personal possession,

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:47.050
a national treasure.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.400
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.280
Prince Li

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:51.170
wouldn't dare forge such a thing.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:00.960
Your Highness,

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:04.310
the Crown Prince went out
with General Li.

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:05.180
He's not here.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.880
Your Highness,

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.770
we couldn't find the Crown Prince.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:19.550
Where is he hiding?

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.630
Tell me,

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.440
and you'll be rewarded.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.350
I'm just a maid
at the General's Residence.

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:25.750
The whereabouts of my masters

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:27.580
are not for me to know or decide.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:30.110
If you wish to find the Crown Prince,

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.150
you may have to wait for General Li
to return.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.550
You're using her authority to pressure me?

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:37.080
I wouldn't dare.

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:39.320
You don't know where the Crown Prince is,

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:39.880
but you

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.810
surely know about the man in black.

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:45.460
Who is he?
