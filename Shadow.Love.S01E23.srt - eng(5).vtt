00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.970
[Episode 23]

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.600
No matter how powerful you are,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.970
you can't defend
against the malice in the dark.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.160
You've been crying for so long.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.210
You'll wake up

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.650
to the swollen eyes tomorrow.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.240
This medicine

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.960
can fix the swelling.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.240
It works wonders.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.030
Also,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.520
Nanxing sacrificed his life for you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.680
because he wanted you to live well,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.680
not to beat yourself up about him

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.079
for the rest of your life.

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.310
He's already gone,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.190
and as the survivor,

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.829
all you can do is move on.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.770
Get some rest.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.090
[General's Residence]

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.920
About the Crown Prince,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.010
have you really made up your mind?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.840
Right now,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.150
numerous people are
keeping eyes on the General's Residence.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.150
We're definitely

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.400
surrounded by Prince Li's spies.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.910
To keep the Crown Prince safe

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.170
and deceive everyone,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.300
we must play this charade.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.390
We can't return to Yunjing anymore.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.870
I'll find a safe place

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.950
and send the Crown Prince there.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.340
His life comes first.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.720
Even fierce tigers don't eat their cubs,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.150
yet as a ruler of a nation,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.750
he's resorted to such despicable means.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.310
How ridiculous.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.430
That's why

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.360
we must protect the Crown Prince

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.470
to safeguard

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.530
Taijin's last hope.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.210
Hope he gets your good intentions.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.350
[Zang Mansion]

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.720
No way.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.360
Your Highness,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.850
the spies have reported

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.159
that General Li actually fell out
with the Crown Prince.

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:44.040
Today at 8 a.m.,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.000
the Changfeng Army

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.060
will escort the Crown Prince's carriage

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.920
out of Lucheng.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.210
Does Li Shuang

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.710
try to distance herself from Su Muyang

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.710
after realizing the consequences?

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:58.790
No matter what,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.120
go intercept the carriage immediately

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.070
and make sure
to bring the Crown Prince back to me.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.800
Understood.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.120
What's the point of panicking?

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.720
Since we've already set out,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.100
excessive anxiety

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.220
won't help anyway.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.750
Lucheng might be remote,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.240
but at least General Li can protect us

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.750
from Prince Li's endless harassment.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.950
Now that we're leaving,

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.360
-I'm afraidâ€¦
-All these years,

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.750
I've been living in fear,

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.950
keeping my head down.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.530
Isn't that just how I've survived?

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.800
That I've made it

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.310
this far alive

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.560
is already a luxury.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.830
Your Highness!

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.750
General Li sending us away

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.250
for their own safety

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.510
is understandable.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.310
But from now on,

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.390
I have no one

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.870
to rely on in this world.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.870
You've followed me for so long.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.790
I will certainly treat you fairly.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.570
If you wish to live out
the rest of your life in peace,

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.860
take this money

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.360
and flee.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.180
Your Highness,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.920
I have served by your side
since childhood.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.720
My life

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.270
already belongs to you, Your Highness.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.190
I will protect you with my life

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.720
and will never abandon you.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.830
Good.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.510
Then you'll

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.600
accompany me through this final ordeal.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.190
Yes.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.409
Lucheng is a remote

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:45.070
and isolated place,

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.470
perfect for secret murder
without leaving a trace.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.540
Do you really think

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:52.470
we can make it out of here alive today?

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.190
Prince Li invites you over.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:07.560
Stay still!

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.000
We have prepared fine horses.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.510
Please mount it now, Crown Prince.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.720
Prince Li is inviting the Crown Prince.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.510
What does that have to do
with a commoner like me

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.910
who's just out for a hike?

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.510
What?

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.870
Tell me.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.300
What do you mean he disappeared?

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.360
Please calm down, Your Highness.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.630
We carried out your command
to intercept the Crown Prince's carriage,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.390
but inside it

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.270
sat only Jin'an
from the General's Residence.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.680
I dared not act rashly,

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.030
so I had to let Jin'an go

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.430
and hurry back to report.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.770
How dare you return without capturing him?

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.040
Without Baoxing around,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.159
none of you seems capable
of doing anything right!

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:44.560
Spare me, Your Highness.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.390
Keep searching.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.430
Bring him to me,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.230
dead or alive.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.159
Understood.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.310
Jin'an deliberately exposed himself

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.800
to lure them into pursuing him.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.460
Prince Li's men took the bait.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.310
The Crown Prince
has secretly left the city.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.720
Once beyond Lucheng's jurisdiction,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.430
the Grand General's friends

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.680
and students along the way
will have his back.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.720
They should be able

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.580
to ensure His Highness's safety.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.200
Jin'an's trick of secret swapping

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.300
has indeed worked.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.390
General.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.690
General.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.360
Reports from outside the city say

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.310
that His Highness's carriage

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.680
hasn't arrived at the meeting point.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.480
The Crown Prince

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.010
seems to have disappeared.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.870
Disappeared?

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:23.980
Yes.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:41.000
Huai'en?

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.150
Huai'en!

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:45.840
Huai'en!

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.370
Your Highness.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.370
Your Highness!

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.590
Did you get hurt, Your Highness?

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.030
Your Highness,

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.160
I'll go check it out.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.780
Protect His Highness!

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:06.440
You guys...

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.110
Huai'en?

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:09.400
Huai'en!

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:26.460
Huai'en.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.320
Huai'en?

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.790
Your Highness,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.360
where are you heading?

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.480
Didn't expect

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.080
Prince Li to have
such an extraordinary sidekick.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:02.750
Prince Li has never

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.550
liked such roundabout tactics.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.800
As remote as that road is,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.940
he could have simply killed me directly

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.870
without going to all this trouble.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.390
Your Highness, you're so sharp-witted.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.230
I was right about you.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.240
Who are you?

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.920
How dare you imprison the Crown Prince?

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.470
How rude of you.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.940
When did I ever imprison His Highness?

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.080
The door is right over there.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.370
If you want to leave,

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.380
you're free to go anytime.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.280
You went to great lengths
to bring me here.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.370
While you haven't treated me
with proper courtesy,

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.900
you haven't hurt me either.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.580
What on earth are you up to?

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.480
Your Highness, you're perceptive.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.150
Prince Li is
desperately trying to kill you.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:11.780
General Li

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.050
is also in a hurry to cut ties with you

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.400
to save her own skin.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.580
But Your Highness,
if you were to leave this place,

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.890
wouldn't that be

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.650
walking straight into danger?

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.220
Staying between two opposing armies,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.970
and being so familiar
with news from the city,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.000
are you

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.590
from Yao State?

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.160
It's a pity, though.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.520
I bear the mere title of Crown Prince

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.490
with no real power.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.910
If you plan to use me

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.700
to force Taijin to submit,

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.940
I'm afraid

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.660
you're wasting your time.

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:46.030
Your Highness,

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.190
just look.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.270
I'm merely

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.200
a wandering brute from the jianghu

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.320
with no place in my heart
for state affairs.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.710
I just feel

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.870
that you, as the Crown Prince,

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.870
are bullied all the time

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.000
and live in constant fear
like a stray dog.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.380
I simply can't stand to watch it anymore.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:13.960
I brought you over

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.270
to offer you a way out

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.980
to start anew.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.270
Tempting smooth talk

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.720
always has a reason behind it.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.120
Rather than waste time
beating around the bush,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.510
why don't you just cut to the chase?

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.270
Fair enough.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.740
The General's Residence

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.700
has something I'm after.

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.910
I heard about the Crown Prince's matter.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.750
Any updates?

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.840
We've searched everywhere along the way.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.960
Not only the Crown Prince,

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.240
but the whole convoy's gone,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.100
as if they vanished into thin air.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.680
Could they have gotten lost?

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.440
The escorting soldiers

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.870
were all carefully selected,

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.080
knowing Lucheng's terrain
like the back of their hands.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.390
I've sent reinforcements

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:03.840
to expand the search area.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.790
We must find him.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.960
Are you going

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.790
to look for him in person?

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.040
This happened because of me.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.150
I can't sit by and do nothing.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.480
Ji Ran and the others are searching
along the way.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.270
Then we

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.430
can check those rugged areas.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.150
We might

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.580
discover something unexpected.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.800
The footprints seem

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.900
to be heading that way.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.080
Let's go.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.790
The footprints

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:52.200
end right here.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:00.870
I've been wondering.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.190
Since those people
using the silver needles

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:04.590
have kept targeting you,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.030
why would they
drag the Crown Prince into it this time?

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.030
Perhaps after losing to me repeatedly,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.360
they couldn't accept it

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.510
and wanted to leverage the Crown Prince

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.770
to force me to come out.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.070
I'm thinking

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.960
that His Highness

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.250
shouldn't have to suffer so much.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.480
Although my father

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.560
has always treated me like his own,

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.240
I've known well
that living under someone else's roof,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.390
I must be careful

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.550
with my words and behaviors.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.440
I know you don't want excessive intakes
of sweets to affect your sword practice,

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.960
so I told the palace maids

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960
to use less sugar.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.320
Others thought I was always standing up
for the Crown Prince,

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.790
but few knew

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.960
that His Highness

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.030
was my only friend back then.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.030
Now,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.040
he's in danger

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.550
due to my oversight.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:02.400
Regret won't help.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.920
We should find the Crown Prince
as soon as possible.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.550
And then

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.040
I'll figure out what to do next.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.579
Let's treat your wound first.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:14.710
If it gets infected,

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:16.589
we'll lose both the Crown Prince

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:17.430
and you.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.170
So what's your plan?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.030
You knew that the man in black

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.430
was one of their targets.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.880
To keep me safe,

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.350
you planned

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.030
to take it all on yourself.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.480
You had to send the Crown Prince away,

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.540
so you felt guilty.

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.450
Yet Prince Li was relentless,

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.060
leaving you nowhere to hide.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.770
So you planned to go all out.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.560
I know everything in your mind,

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.240
and I'll help you make it all.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.970
You've been on edge lately,

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.500
not even getting any proper rest.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:10.400
Shuang,

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.070
you still have me by your side.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.680
You're willing to risk your life for me,

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.770
and I would do the same for you.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.470
I don't want to see anyone die.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.440
I just want to end this mess

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.030
and spend

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.800
the rest of my life with you.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.160
In those biography scrolls I've read,

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.870
all the young ladies
would cry their eyes out

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.270
at the slightest injury.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.780
But look at you.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.590
With all these wounds,

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.070
you haven't even flinched,

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.030
let alone shed a tear.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.730
Ever since I entered Lucheng,

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.510
I'm no longer some pampered lady.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.380
I'm the General of the Changfeng Army.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.840
I have neither the time

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.240
nor the luxury to be weak.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.280
But I'm different from the others.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.240
You are everyone's general,

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.400
yet you're my one and only beloved Shuang.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.090
It's alright.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.200
Neither I

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.210
nor these lush woods and bright moon

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.270
would know it.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.240
Master.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.750
Li Shuang's broken
into the secret forest with her man.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.210
They're heading this way.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.310
I knew she would come,

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.220
but I didn't expect it to be this soon.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.440
Seems like you don't have much time left

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.640
to consider, Your Highness.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:03.550
You and Prince Li are

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.000
meant for a fight to the death.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.350
Instead of

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.920
fleeing and hiding,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.730
why not go all out
and fight to the bitter end?

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:13.920
Your Highness,

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.590
I can ensure your survival

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.510
or even help you rise to power
in one fell swoop,

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.350
free from future worries.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.310
As Crown Prince,

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.110
you have no power, no influence.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.170
And even the loyalty
and friendship that could've

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.890
saved your life are gone now.

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.850
If you don't join hands with me,

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:42.520
what other path

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.630
do you have other than death?

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.570
What are you after

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.240
in the General's Residence?

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.310
The man in black,

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.730
Jin'an.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.400
I can sense

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.530
the stronger aura of the Crown Prince.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.490
Help.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:30.160
Help...

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.720
Help me.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:34.410
Your Highness.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.820
Your Highness!

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.000
Are you hurt, Your Highness?

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.090
Let's first find a way

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.090
to take them back.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.120
Your Highness!

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.330
Anxiety and fear

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.260
have made it hard for you to focus.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.000
Though there are no serious problems,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.200
you still need some good rest.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.060
Your Highness.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:09.310
Your Highness.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:10.600
Run, Your Highness.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:11.680
Your Highness, run.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.440
Your Highness.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.310
Mr. Mo Yin.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.240
Your Highness.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.790
Huai'en was injured because of me.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:16.640
Could you

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.300
check on him for me?

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.420
Of course, Your Highness.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.550
I treat

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.920
all patients equally,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.290
with no distinction

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.460
between princes and commoners.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.270
[That weird.]

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.680
[Why do]

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.010
[these wounds show traces
of Wuling Mountain techniques?]

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:56.950
Is there something wrong?

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.960
Don't worry, Your Highness.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.440
Despite some internal injuries,

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.640
no vital parts were hurt, fortunately.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.670
He only needs some medicine
to promote circulation

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:08.870
and reduce bruising.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.290
Your Highness.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.760
Are you alright, Your Highness?

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.360
His Highness is fine.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.370
Your Highness.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:31.560
Do you know

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.880
who abducted you?

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.800
Who else could it be?

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.510
As long as I'm alive,

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.440
my dear brother

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.160
won't easily let me go.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.600
Had Huai'en not saved me,

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.000
I would probably

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.430
be dead now.

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:56.960
This one's on me.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.050
Sorry for my oversight

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.770
and lack of consideration.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.810
-I promise that next time...
-Promise what?

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.940
Promise that next time

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.760
you'll successfully
throw me even farther away?

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:17.440
General,

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.160
His Highness just got out of danger
and needs some peace and rest.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.160
Please talk to him

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.960
after His Highness feels better.

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:26.960
Then we will

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.200
take our leave.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.200
Mr. Mo Yin, please hold on a minute.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.810
Due to treacherous mountain paths,

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.070
I accidentally got some minor injuries.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.300
Would you mind helping me dress them?

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:01.290
General, you truly are a remarkable woman.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.200
You don't seem concerned
about the social distance

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.640
between men and women.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.290
How clumsy the man was

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.930
to bandage the wound

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.310
this badly!

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.000
Thank you for your help, sir.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:20.200
Sir, you've put aside our past grudges

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.260
and offered us so much generous help.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.050
I really appreciate it.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.640
General, Miss Lu told me

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:28.730
that you never

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.220
take good care of yourself

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.200
and even pay

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:33.350
no attention

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:34.510
to minor wounds.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.960
You specifically asked me
to dress your wounds today.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:37.920
I guess

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.270
you have something to ask me, right?

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.110
His Highness was thrown
into a great fright this time.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.440
Is he really alright?

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:46.810
Not only is he fine,

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:49.960
he's even in much better shape
than you are, General.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:51.240
Then

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:53.880
what about Huai'en?

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.340
This man is extremely loyal.

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:01.770
I think he must have been

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:04.130
fretting over
the Crown Prince's situation recently,

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:05.990
causing him digestive problems.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.400
Just now,

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:08.790
when I checked his pulse,

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:09.590
guess what I found?

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:10.270
What?

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.730
His constipation

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:13.930
has lasted for at least five days.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:19.880
In this case,

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.240
it seems

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.160
that I was overthinking it.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.960
It's never wrong to overthink
a matter of life and death.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.770
In my opinion,

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:28.590
it's uneasy to cure him.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.510
If this keeps up,

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.100
I'm afraid
it could lead to serious complications.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.160
Where

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:57.550
did you get this?

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.930
Weren't you so into the show
you put on just now?

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:04.680
Why quit acting now?

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.240
Ever since you showed up in Lu City,

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:10.070
I've suspected your identity.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.730
Despite our meticulous plan,

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:14.500
the Crown Prince was still abducted.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.510
So it was because of you,

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.280
a spy hiding in my place.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.080
General, you must be joking.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:25.520
Not even the deepest dungeon
could hold me.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.710
For the Crown Prince, a mere weakling,

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.270
why would I bother
working as a spy for others?

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.030
Since you recognize this needle,

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:33.720
you must know its owner

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.000
and must be involved in it somehow.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.510
If you don't come clean,

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.940
I'll have no choice
but to throw you into prison

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.740
for relentless interrogation.

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.500
Why don't you let people finish speaking

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.060
before resorting to force?

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:05.680
I don't know why this person

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.280
kidnapped the Crown Prince.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.310
I came to your place

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:11.570
for the man in black.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.550
Or should I say,

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.270
Jin'an?

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.270
How much do you know about him?

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.960
General, you can rest assured.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.790
I've been at your residence
for so many days.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.310
If I truly wanted to harm anyone,

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:24.590
I'd have done it long ago.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:26.240
Why would I wait until today?

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.720
During your long stay at my residence,

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:31.650
you've been keeping a low profile.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.530
I guess it's because

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.300
you're no match
for the man in black, right?

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.270
As unpredictable
as your martial arts skills are,

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.550
I can do nothing to you.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.680
Guess I'll

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:49.710
have to call Jin'an for help.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.510
I once thought
you were an upright and reliable general.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.110
Didn't expect you

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.830
to be as cunning as Jin'an.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.490
The Jade Linglong inside Jin'an's body is

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:14.750
a sacred relic of my Wuling Mountain.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.180
Do you mean

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.240
that only by removing the Jade Linglong

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.400
can we save Jin'an?

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:27.400
This way, we can save

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.350
not only him, but also you

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.110
and all the other living beings.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:32.570
Will it endanger his life?

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.520
No, it won't.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.330
But whether it's removed or not,

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:39.130
all his memories of you, General,

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.100
will be totally wiped out.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.170
Jin'an and I originally agreed

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.240
that when everything was settled,

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.550
he'd go to Wuling Mountain with me.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:51.070
But given the complicated situation now,

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.920
he doesn't have much time left.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.070
I have to...

00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.920
I have to spill

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.400
everything to you

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.160
like a big-mouthed guy.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.240
If he refuses

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.270
to go with me one day in the future,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.760
I might

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.980
need to ask for your help, General.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.510
Has Jin'an

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.930
known about this all along?

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.440
He didn't want you to worry,

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.240
so he kept it from you on purpose.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.550
I'm not in cahoots

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.170
with this silver needle's owner.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.110
Many years ago,

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.730
my godfather was murdered,

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.710
and the Jade Linglong was stolen.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:37.530
The same silver needle

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:38.810
was left at the scene.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:40.990
I have a blood feud with its owner.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:43.880
General, please

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:45.570
tell me the truth about it.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.140
Since I brought Jin'an
back to my residence,

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.730
this person has launched
several attacks on us.

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.260
He acts in a mysterious way,

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.300
coming and going without a trace.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.240
I know very little about him.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.030
The only clue is

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.350
that he can use silver needles

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.050
to manipulate innocent people at will.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.600
Could it be the acupoint-sealing needle?

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:17.620
Some time ago,

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:19.370
I had Jin'an draw his portrait

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.490
and searched everywhere,

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.310
but still found no trace of him.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.310
So you do recognize him, sir.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.030
Who is he?

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.540
I can not jump to conclusions,

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.910
but I will certainly
get to the bottom of it.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.080
This person kidnapped the Crown Prince,

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.000
yet was willing to let him return
safe and sound.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.660
He must be up to something big.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.310
I urge you, General,

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.490
not to let your guard down.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:15.810
The shadow puppet is way too powerful.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.010
I've set several traps.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.900
Still, he not only escaped easily

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.630
but also injured me.

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:24.710
The shadow puppet and the Jade Linglong
haven't perfectly merged yet.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:26.510
If he loses his mind,

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:29.150
the consequences
of the chaotic power can be devastating.

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.880
If we don't act decisively now,

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:33.920
it'll be a big threat
looming large in the future.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:43.659
You're already so exhausted,

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:45.389
yet you still try to stay awake?

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.270
Let me finish what I'm working on first.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.440
I'm sorry

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.740
for keeping you up so late with me.

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.650
I couldn't fall asleep anyway.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:04.910
You've been working
until the middle of the night.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.670
What

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:07.130
is this exactly?

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:11.610
This is the child doll I made for Nanxing.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.360
And this is his wife.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.080
I've thought it over.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.150
I plan to visit him

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:19.960
first thing tomorrow morning.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.710
You're right.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.210
There's something

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:24.440
we must get over.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.070
Those who remain

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.960
need to move on.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.400
Nanxing saved your life.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.110
The doll you made is so ugly.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.590
Isn't that

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.800
repaying kindness with ingratitude?

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.230
I've tried my best.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:53.580
Nanxing's biggest wish in life

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:55.490
was to have a family of his own.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.150
Now that he's gone,

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.630
no matter what,

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.440
I must do everything I can

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.480
to fulfill that wish for him.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.010
With such good intentions,

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:09.200
you're certainly honoring
all that Nanxing did for you.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.260
To honor his kindness,

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.280
I should find the one who killed him

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.170
and finish the murderer

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.510
to avenge him.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.360
An eye for an eye,
and this cycle of revenge will never end.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.190
Do you have to trap yourself
in this worldly karma?

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:28.000
You're saying so

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.600
because you've never experienced

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.670
the pain of losing someone close to you.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:33.360
Now that he's gone,

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:34.920
these things

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:36.590
are just meant to ease

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:37.960
the regrets and guilt

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:39.320
of the living.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.320
They're all fake.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.980
Make the murderer pay with his life.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.550
That's the only real thing
I can do for him.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.610
What if

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:53.470
the killer is someone
on good terms with you

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.240
or even one of your family members?

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.540
Would you still have to kill them?

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:06.500
If they were truly my family,

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:09.230
how could they hurt someone
important to me?

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.300
Nanxing,

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.230
I've brought you your wife and child.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.400
You can rest in peace now.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.380
Thank you

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.690
for making such a beautiful family
for Nanxing.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.800
I might be

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:49.320
leaving soon.

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:51.090
This is Clear Moon Pearl.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:52.230
Take it.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.400
Why give me something so valuable?

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.030
You want to rebuild the clinic,

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.740
and I can't think of any other way

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.690
to help you.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.000
Ordinary people love fortune.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:02.180
Money is always

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.490
the way to go.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.070
Jin'an,

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:19.760
I need to leave the General's Residence
for something urgent.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.490
Do you remember our agreement?

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.480
There's something

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.610
I want to figure out.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.590
What do you think makes shadow puppets

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:27.550
lose control?

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:29.570
I'm not sure.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.360
I only heard about it

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:33.000
from my godfather when I was young.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.110
Many years ago,

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.030
there was a shadow puppet
in the mountains.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.670
It seemed like a normal man,

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.960
who even got married
and had children in the village below,

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.550
living an ordinary life.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.590
But later, for some reason,

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.630
it suddenly lost control

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:46.750
and slaughtered everyone

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:48.980
in the entire village within one night.

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.060
Therefore,

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.050
to ensure peace for all people,

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.640
I must take you back with me.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:38:59.690
I'll go with you.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.930
The moment you told me

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.610
that the Jade Linglong
would drain Shuang's life,

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.320
I just made this decision.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.500
But right now, Lucheng is in turmoil.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:15.760
Shuang is caught in the middle of it

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.020
and having a hard time.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:19.400
I need to help her
get through this crisis first.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.360
But the Jade Linglong is unpredictable.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.150
What if you

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:24.280
completely lose control before then?

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.510
If I lose control,

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:31.510
can you protect the people
at the General's Residence for me?

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:33.580
I have no connection with them.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.660
I only want to get what I'm after.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.190
If I totally lose it,

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:46.840
please

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.130
guarantee their safety

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.100
even if it means killing me.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.710
I promise you

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.860
that once everything is settled,

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:55.790
I'll go with you.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.410
Alright,

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:04.790
I promise you

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.230
that I'll do my best.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.080
If necessary,

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.160
I'll take extreme measures.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:20.190
Thank you.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.920
Do shadow puppets

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.240
also have compassion

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.850
and concerns about others' lives?

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:45.320
Your Highness,

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.190
latest reports say

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.320
that Li Shuang's brought the Crown Prince

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.180
back to the General's Residence.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.520
When did this happen?

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.000
Around dawn.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:54.110
After they returned,

00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:55.800
the General's Residence
shut the doors to all visitors.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.570
Not even a fly had come out

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:58.090
until sunset.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.400
Li Shuang

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:02.280
sent the Crown Prince away
and then brought him back again.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.710
What trick is she playing?

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:06.000
What's the use of wild speculation?

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.010
Who's there?

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.370
Your Highness, don't be afraid.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.110
I mean you no harm.

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.510
I've come

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.680
to offer you

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.790
a great gift.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:33.880
Everyone, leave us alone.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.760
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:44.010
Your Highness,
if you want to kill the Crown Prince,

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:46.670
you just need to strike directly.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:49.520
Although Li Shuang commands
powerful forces,

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.920
the Changfeng Army isn't

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.730
the Li family's private army after all.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.510
She wouldn't dare use them arbitrarily.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:59.440
The General's Residence
has only a few dozen people.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.520
As long as you bring enough troops,

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.000
there's no way you'll lose.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.570
Since you know this matter so well,

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.030
how could you not know

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:10.280
that Li Shuang's got

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:11.630
a man in black who has

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:14.150
overwhelming power
to even fight thousands of soldiers?

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:16.950
Please don't worry about that man,
Your Highness.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:18.490
On the day of the heavenly calamity,

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:21.220
he will certainly not appear before you.
