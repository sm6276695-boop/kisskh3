00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.570
You were my first love.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.250
I said you were my first love.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.430
First love?

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.910
Are you... Really... What...

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.520
Are you acting shy? You, Lee Ji An?

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.430
N-No, right?

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.470
What are you saying?

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.300
A lot of people have told me I'm their first love.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.610
So, I don't feel shy at all.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.510
I'm very used to situations like this.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.490
Gosh, first love isn't such a big deal.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.720
Right?

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.030
Yup.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.270
My gosh.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.800
There are fireworks. Bang, bang.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.120
Should we go this way?

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.460
- So, by the way, Oppa,
- Yeah.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.250
you had very high standards
despite your looks, right?

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.500
My nickname was Minor League.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.640
Because I had an unusual taste.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.060
It's because they didn't have a good look at me.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.130
The person who said that had 20/20 vision.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.860
He saw you dancing in the schoolyard.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.830
Beauty usually feels unfamiliar at first.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.170
You always have the last word.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.380
I never let things go.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.420
Hi, Tae Oh.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.840
Hello.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.660
What? Did you fall on the way?

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.000
Why are your eyelids red?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.010
Are they?

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.120
I put a little bit of eyeshadow on.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.960
Fu Bao better watch out.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.260
There's a funnier human here.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.970
What do you know about makeup?

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.520
Are you wearing a hairpin?

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.910
Is something up with you?

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.900
There must be a reason you're acting differently.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.120
Either confessed your love or
someone confessed to you.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.730
What are you, a profiler?

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.010
Hey, this is a warning.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.620
Don't analyze my behavioral pattern and stuff.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.670
Are you flustered much?

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.940
- Hello, Ahjussi.
- Hi.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.210
I'm going to the farm to work.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.530
What's with your eyes? What are you, a panda?

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.940
I'm off.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.490
You beat Fu Bao.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.100
You're impressive.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.130
- That's enough. Seriously.
- Okay.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.140
I'll do my homework for the art studio.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.340
I'll be back quickly.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.350
Don't come quickly. Take your time.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.450
Tae Oh and I will enjoy each other's company.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.280
I feel sorry for Tae Oh.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.620
What?

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.800
Let's enjoy each other's company.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.770
Shall we?

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.510
- Shall we enjoy?
- Yes.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.900
Let's polish spoons and chopsticks together.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.500
Gosh.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.840
The weather is nice, too.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.380
- Hello.
- Hey.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.570
You know the wall in the front?

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.860
It needs to be repaired.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.060
It could hurt someone if you leave it like that.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.450
You'll have to fix it yourself.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.670
She sees things sometimes.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.200
Don't tell anyone about it.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.390
She's building good karma.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.380
She says it'll bring you good luck.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.230
You're so knowledgeable, Village Leader Go.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.610
Not just anyone can be a village leader.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.080
Right, I'm fine anytime you decide.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.790
Come and build good karma when you can.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.000
I bet you two never get bored.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.360
- I'll go.
- Right?

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.560
- Bye.
- See you.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.090
Bye.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.660
- Where are you going?
- Huh?

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.420
Are you going to draw?

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.450
I wanted to unleash my artistic passion
before we open.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.930
Get in. I'll take you somewhere really nice.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.520
Wow. It's so pretty.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.460
If you just follow me,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.310
you'd only be walking on flowery paths.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.440
I don't want to admit it, but I guess it's true.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.230
Be careful.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.550
Should we sit over there?

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.550
Should we sit here?

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.290
Gosh, are you doing that again?

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.960
That's a chronic condition, Oppa.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.190
You get a better sense of the view this way.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.740
Yes, this is good.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.340
Although I'm not sure you could capture this.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.020
- I'm here, Oppa.
- Huh?

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.620
I blend in with the flowers too well.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.620
In case you can't find me.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.220
So, I'm kindly telling you where I am.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.210
You're so you.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.500
Only you stick out here.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.130
You say what you want to say
and don't listen to others.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.920
It's very bad.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.870
- Oppa.
- Yeah?

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.330
I always thought these flowers were purple.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.500
But there's a bit of white in there.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.170
- You didn't know, either. Right?
- Huh?

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.880
Wow. You guys had colors like these.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.240
Yes. I'll capture everything.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.240
There's no perfect purple for it.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.320
I'll use this.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.150
What's with your eyes?

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.320
Do they look weird?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.530
[Episode 9. If I fell in love for the first time]

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:46.420
We'll never get back together.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.210
Watch your mouth in front of people.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.690
I won't tolerate it next time.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.010
Huh?

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.820
You're back early.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.680
Yes.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.650
Well, I have a day off tomorrow.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.740
Should we eat out?

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.430
There's a restaurant I want to check out.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.150
That's a good idea.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.670
Really?

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.300
What time are you free tomorrow?

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.100
I'll meet you at your office.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.300
Why do you ask that? You're eating out alone.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.940
You'll end up coming with me.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.210
Don't fight it.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.660
- Hold these.
- Huh?

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.100
Hold these.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.630
- Why?
- Okay...

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.740
Smile.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.120
- Cheese.
- Seriously.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.660
Wow. Which one's the flower?

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.530
I've always noticed this,
but your taste in men is...

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.620
exceptional. It's on another level.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.790
Maybe the flowers are prettier.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.960
Are these going to Seoul today, by the way?

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.990
No. They're going to Japan.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.100
Japan? Wow.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:29.660
You guys are better off than I am.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.040
I haven't been to Japan.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.710
To be honest, my trip to Cheonghae
was my first trip ever.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.100
I've never been on a trip before.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.920
Mom was busy, and I was busy studying, too.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.620
I was planning to take a trip far away
once I finished medical school.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.050
Go with me.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.030
Go on a trip with me.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.350
Well, I'll think about it.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:13.380
Hey, what's this?

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.690
I'm on my way to catch the flower boy now.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.030
Hey,

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.550
Sook got angry because of the photo.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.560
She's coming to Cheonghae to catch you.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.020
What?

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.470
That means Sook is coming to Cheonghae.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.090
Sook is coming! Sook is coming!

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.390
Sook! Sook!

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.670
What should we eat?

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.800
- What should we eat?
- What should we eat?

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.200
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.260
I'm building good karma.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.710
Are you happy about something these days?

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.610
You're busy getting dolled up
and building good karma.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.330
Yes. You don't have to know.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.840
When is Sook coming?

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.140
Around five.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.930
Bo Hyeon and I will finish work and pick her up.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.330
- I'm leaving.
- Okay.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.220
Bye.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.760
Let's go.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.560
I'll meet you at the office at six.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:00.380
How will you do this on your own?

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.450
Village Leader Go and her husband
went downtown today.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.200
I can handle this on my own.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.610
But still. You're making me feel bad
if you work alone like this.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.120
Huh? That's Bo Hyeon's mom, right?

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.020
Why?

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.160
What?

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.160
You're doing this alone?

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.780
Do you even know how to?

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.970
It'd take a whole day.

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.500
I'll manage it myself. Be on your way.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.630
Should I?

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.200
Jeong Seok and I are going out to dinner tonight.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.220
I need to get back and get ready.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.610
I'm sorry I can't help you.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.950
Carry on, then.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.250
Okay. Be on your way.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:01.750
Let's see.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.980
What was Mr. Ryu's number?

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.280
I can just call Mr. Ryu.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.440
Excuse me.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.790
What?

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:22.430
You know you have to apply it thoroughly, right?

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.350
I've done part-time jobs while studying abroad.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:27.370
You can't design if you don't know how to build.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.130
Geez. I've never traveled abroad.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.130
What's it like to live abroad?

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.430
Living abroad is...

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.160
filled with newness,

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.250
loneliness,

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.970
and sadness.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.630
Stuff like that.

00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:51.705
It was so hard at first,
but I thought I could do anything.

00:14:51.705 --> 00:14:53.855
I suppose I was young then.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:15:00.330
To change one's fate,
if you live ambitiously for the future,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.900
you get used to the environment.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:08.400
Once you get used to it,
you feel, "I'm an outsider after all."

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.230
You feel the limitation of your identity.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.560
That makes you feel lonely.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.960
Once you realize you're lonely, you feel sad.

00:15:18.855 --> 00:15:20.500
That's how it was for me.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.860
It's not because you lived abroad.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:27.000
Life is supposed to be lonely and sad.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.450
I guess you were lonely and sad.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.860
I was.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.380
But not really.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.440
Are you playing hot and cold with me?

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.640
Life told me, "Aren't you worn out to death?

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.280
Let's see how long you can last."

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.370
So, I endured it out of spite.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:47.000
And then I stopped feeling that way.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.130
She got to me while I let my guard down.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.190
You almost made my heart flutter.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.760
Hello.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.040
Huh?

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.160
Are you on a break?

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.160
Yes.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.950
Byeong Jae, have you not had lunch yet?

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.530
Well, I've had indigestion since yesterday.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:33.240
I feel drained because I haven't eaten anything.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.520
You're sick.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.000
Let me see.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.620
Here.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.220
Does it hurt here?

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.770
Does it hurt?

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.880
They say that boys and girls should
be segregated after the age of 7.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.680
I believe men and women
above 60 should accelerate.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.390
Above 60...

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:57.230
Oh, I knew what that meant. I couldn't
think of it immediately.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.230
This part needs to hurt.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.460
I don't think you have indigestion
if it doesn't hurt here.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.780
Is it because I overworked
at the job site the last few days?

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.550
You've been stressed.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.750
Hold on. For Byeong Jae, I'll...

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.780
get you buckwheat tea.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.660
Drink this and take it easy here for now.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.170
Thank you.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.460
I have some abalone prepped.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.930
I'll make you porridge.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.290
I'll make a lot. Eat the rest for dinner later.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:36.790
Okay. Thank you.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.620
I like abalone porridge, too.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.830
Huh? Really?

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.360
Okay. I'll pack you some, too.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.790
Let's see.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.810
- Byeong Jae.
- Yes.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.900
I saw you working when this house was being built.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:01.610
I'm not just saying this. You worked really hard.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:07.690
I could tell how thoughtful
and attentive you were.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.420
I guess I felt a bit worried, too, should I say?

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.620
Okay, listen. Well...

00:18:19.967 --> 00:18:24.800
working hard enough
so you don't hurt your relationship

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:30.895
with coworkers and not strain your body
would make you a real pro.

00:18:30.895 --> 00:18:33.545
- I'm just saying, don't get sick.
- Okay.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.920
The abalone is so meaty.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.800
- You want water?
- No.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.440
Go ahead.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.780
It'll dry in 30 minutes.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.360
You must be tired. You're more tenacious
than I thought.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.560
This neighborhood is so strange.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.030
I'm a very selfish person.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.640
But it makes me want to pretend to be nice.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.560
Did someone say you're nice?

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.960
- Well?
- You don't seem nice,

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.020
but you don't seem selfish, either.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.170
You don't know how to assess people.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.880
I'm a very selfish person.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.720
I need to get what I want, no matter what.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.700
I have a twin brother.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.140
My parents always put him first.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.100
We weren't well off.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.740
My parents let my brother
go to the school he chose,

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.250
but they made me go to one
that offered a scholarship.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.820
Since I was a kid, I made sure I had my share.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.710
I always achieved what I wanted to.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.670
I just became more spiteful.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.400
I've been hated a lot for that reason, too.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.490
Why is it bad to acquire and achieve

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:59.160
the things you want?

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.890
I envy people like that.

00:20:02.865 --> 00:20:04.717
I'm always defeated.

00:20:04.717 --> 00:20:08.925
I get defeated by the world and people.

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.625
I really don't want to be,

00:20:13.625 --> 00:20:16.795
but no matter how hard I try, I still lose.

00:20:18.025 --> 00:20:20.530
I don't want to. But it's hard not to.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.670
That's why I envy people like you.

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.230
That was why.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.520
I wondered why you were so tough.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.510
I guess knowing how to lose makes you that way.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.920
You don't break because you're soft.

00:20:43.258 --> 00:20:46.030
If so, Ji An,

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:50.060
can I ask you a favor?

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.530
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:55.920
Sir, where are the colored pencils?

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.655
They're here.

00:20:57.655 --> 00:20:59.585
Oh, here they are.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.770
Okay. Purple... let's see...

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.465
- Is this purple, too?
- Yes. Light purple.

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:08.495
Light purple.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.100
My gosh.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.790
Wow. You're almost done.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.540
Gosh, you've done so much.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.790
Be careful. Be careful.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.150
Don't worry.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.000
Don't touch this for about two days.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.390
There must've been a flowering tree here.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.510
After my husband built this wall,

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:42.120
he planted flowers in front of it for me.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.400
But after he died,

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.090
I hated to see the petals falling.
So, I removed all of them.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.530
But look how resilient they are.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:57.470
My heart broke when he left.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.350
The wall also broke.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.180
And the petals fell, too.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.650
I'm done.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.510
Yeo Jeong!

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:20.600
Are you okay?

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.160
[Examination Room]

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.390
Ms. Jeong Ju Hyeon.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:24.900
Yes.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.940
Do they say you're okay?

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.790
I think I'm already healed.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.340
They say it's nothing serious. Don't worry.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.780
It just can't get inflamed.

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.990
Gosh, it's my fault.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.820
You're pretending to be nice again.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.530
You caught me.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.560
It looks bad, doesn't it?

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.080
There was a fire in my apartment
two years ago, and I got burned.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.290
I'm still not used to it, either.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:06.140
Oh, don't tell Jeong Seok.

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.830
He doesn't know I got injured.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.460
I didn't tell him.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.560
Looks like you were badly hurt.

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.980
Treating burns wasn't easy.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.460
Is it because I was struggling?

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.980
I got burnt out from work then, too.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.880
I underwent psychiatric treatment, too.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.230
I had a pretty hard time.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.890
So, I couldn't come to Korea
to see Bo Hyeon for two years.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.250
Do both Jeong Seok and Bo Hyeon not know, then?

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:39.210
I thought of my family the most
when I got injured.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.760
I regretted a lot.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.820
That's also why I didn't tell them.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.470
I wanted to be back once I had recovered.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.390
I...

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.340
was trying in my own way.

[Bus Terminal]

Lee Sook.

She's pretending to be blindsided.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:42.030
I was going to tell you, Sook.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.840
Long time no see.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.440
She's happy to see me, right?

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.440
She's not usually like this.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.640
It's okay. So Yeon does this to me a lot.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.270
I'm used to it.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.760
Sook, Sook.

Hold on. I'm sorry. I mean it.

- Honey.
- What's going on?

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:23.100
I was working on Mimi Corner Store's fence.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.930
While she was helping with that...

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.390
Are you the village's problem solver?

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.000
Why do you keep causing trouble here and there?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.690
It was a simple job.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.110
What do you mean, simple?

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.250
She got injured.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:38.200
No. I'm not badly injured.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.260
I'm just wearing a brace.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:43.870
Get in.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.630
Like this. Go.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.260
Oh, hello.

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.400
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.490
Hello.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.330
I'm back.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:31.300
Gosh. You fixed Mimi's wall all day, huh?

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.900
That's why you're so tired.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.290
No, I'm not tired.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.930
I'll help here. Go and rest.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.260
You don't look well.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.970
Yes. We're pretty much done cooking.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.730
Dr. Jung and I can finish it up. Go rest.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:48.730
Hey!

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:49.920
Huh?

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.710
Go inside and rest. Go on.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.780
Okay. Thank you.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.090
I'll turn in early today.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:08.260
What's Sook doing?

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.400
Dr. Jung, come this way.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.170
When did you guys get together?

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.380
The day you kissed is the first day, right?

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.490
Shut up, please.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.000
Kiss? Kiss?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.820
Hey, did you kiss him, too?

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.650
I didn't not kiss.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.090
Hey, why did you seduce the innocent Hyo Ri?

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.300
She has never dated before. She's pure.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.850
Sook. Shut up.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.310
It's true.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.730
No. That wasn't my first kiss.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.270
Hey!

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.690
Bo Hyeon is like that, too.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.110
Move.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.050
Soju.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.560
Bo Hyeon is...

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.730
as pure as a priest.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.260
Hey, be honest.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.470
You've never dated once. Right?

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.550
What are you saying? No, no.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.290
- It's true.
- No, no.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:18.430
It's true.

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.260
She's the only free-range chicken among us.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.860
We shuffled from home, school, and the field.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.550
We were basically like monks.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.580
Shut up.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:29.020
Did you just call me a chicken?

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.940
Look down.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.565
Ji An,

00:28:51.565 --> 00:28:55.615
can I ask you a favor?

00:28:57.693 --> 00:28:59.648
I...

00:28:59.648 --> 00:29:03.698
came to Korea to get back together
with Jeong Seok.

00:29:04.835 --> 00:29:07.980
Bo Hyeon, Jeong Seok, the three of us.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.490
I want us to have a fresh start.

00:29:11.785 --> 00:29:17.030
But I think Jeong Seok is distracted by you.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.830
Could you not distract him?

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.810
I really...

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.270
want a fresh start with him.

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:40.420
You know Hyo Ri used to attend
medical school, right?

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.960
Her college entrance exam score
was in the top 0.05%.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.790
Bo Hyeon is the farm's successor.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.300
- A landscape design certificate...
- He has a landscape design certificate, too.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:51.710
- Hey.
- Huh?

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.920
Do you think I'm bragging about you?

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.600
I'm trying to say that she's nothing.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:01.160
I hate you and her. I just hate everyone.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.300
I like you, though.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.810
Hey, why do you hate Hyo Ri?

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.890
She's actually a good person.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.440
I hated her from the beginning,

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.200
but I hate her even more because of you.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.160
Okay, guys,

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.110
I've been listening to you for a while.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.580
I think you argued enough.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.310
You're drunk enough, too.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:27.690
How about you settle with a physical fight?

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:28.750
Pardon?

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.100
How refreshing. I love it.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.330
Should we fight at Yijeong Elementary School?
There's no one around there.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.010
It's close to a hospital, too.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:39.850
He's just like Tae Oh.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.880
Anyway, we'll go home.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.740
Please clean up the rest.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:45.640
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.050
Report the result of the fight.

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.400
- Okay.
- Got it.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.590
- Take care.
- Good night.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.930
Hey, come out.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:54.700
Let's go. Let's go now.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:55.950
- To where?
- We're going?

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:57.830
- I can use a weapon, right?
- No, no. You can't.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.120
Hey, I can fight underwater, too.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.180
Underwater? She said underwater. Hey.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.840
What do I do with her?

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.200
- Are we really going?
- Call my parents in advance.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.440
- Hey.
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.200
Don't do it. You'll get hurt.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.680
She's no joke.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.900
Hey, I'm Lee Sook.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.900
Yes, just call it even. Our bones
don't heal well anymore.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.630
What are you saying?

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.500
My motto is, "Losing is better than not trying."

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.480
Okay, then...

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.250
the one who finishes six laps first wins.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.820
Okay. Ready...

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.280
Start!

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.460
Run! Run!

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.060
- Look at them go!
- Go!

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.760
- Lee Sook!
- They're good. They're good.

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.810
- Fighting!
- They're so fast.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.070
Lee Sook started the third lap!

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:18.110
Kim So Yeon's on the third lap!
It's neck and neck!

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.550
She's catching up!

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.560
Why don't you give up?

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.850
You give up.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.820
What's giving up?

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.060
I don't know...

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:39.160
I don't know what that means.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:42.490
Hey!

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:43.940
What?

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.870
I'll give up.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.510
- What? Why did they stop?
- What?

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:51.590
Are they actually fighting?

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.220
- Are they having a fist fight?
- No, right?

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.310
I said I'll lose.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.920
You can win everything.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.100
I'll let you be the best.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.680
And you...

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:13.280
should understand Hyo Ri.

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:16.700
I get it.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.900
She could come across as rude.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.110
I admit it. I totally do.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.240
But...

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.040
she's trying not to get hurt
because she's soft-hearted.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.390
So, please understand her.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.830
She has a situation.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.260
I want to be by her side,

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.580
but I know that'd make it harder for her.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.810
That's why I'm asking you a favor.

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.360
Hey, she's giving up!

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.960
I won!

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.500
- What?
- What?

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.060
Did she win or lose?

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.010
Hey, don't worry.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.205
Even if you didn't ask me,

00:34:23.205 --> 00:34:27.105
we wouldn't have let her feel lonely.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.220
I won!

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.590
Kim So Yeon's the best!

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.450
- Good job.
- I knew you'd win.

00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:43.970
Lee Hyo Ri.

00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:47.010
You cheered for me, too. Didn't you?

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:48.310
I didn't cheer for you.

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.630
You did.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:52.580
Did you see me?

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.200
Sook, I cheered for you.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.430
- Good job. Really...
- No way.

00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:58.070
Where are you going? Where are you going?

00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:59.430
Why? Why?

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:01.110
Don't come!

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.870
Hey, manage your boyfriend better.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.640
What did I do?

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:18.350
When I said hello to Ahjumma,

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.410
I felt her kindness very briefly.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.630
Really? You're terrified of my mom.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.380
I know.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.540
There's something in this village's water.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.530
Ahjumma changed.

00:35:35.008 --> 00:35:36.708
By the way,

00:35:37.695 --> 00:35:40.010
what do you like about Bo Hyeon?

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.310
Because he's handsome?

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:45.725
Hey, there are tons of guys
who are as good-looking.

00:35:45.725 --> 00:35:48.195
Do you really think so?

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.060
Bo Hyeon...

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:06.100
makes you think about that very
moment when you're with him.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.310
He lets you look at the world simply,

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:13.020
and he makes me honest.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.510
I love that.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:19.130
He removes complicated thoughts.
My head doesn't hurt when I'm with him.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.300
Does your head...

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.830
hurt a lot?

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.890
Don't you feel scared?

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.140
That's a relief.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.820
Goodnight.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:56.700
You're mine, Sook.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.030
Hey, that...

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.890
Jae Dong, you know.

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.175
Does he have a girlfriend?

00:37:10.175 --> 00:37:12.255
H-He's my type.

00:37:13.195 --> 00:37:15.560
Hey, do you like that type?

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.630
I mean, he has such a cute smile.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.940
He's better than Bo Hyeon.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.420
Are your eyes already aging?

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.070
- No.
- Seriously.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:27.100
His land is 6,000 pyeong.

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.850
He has a halo around him. So cute.

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.890
Bo Hyeon has thousands of flowers.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:34.790
What will you do with flowers?

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:38.220
Jae Dong raises onions. Onions.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.790
- Can we make it work?
- H-How could you...

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.370
compare him to Bo Hyeon...

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:44.460
Would you like me to...

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:47.020
help you out somehow?

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.590
I mean, if there's a way...

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.560
I'd like you to, but...

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.490
Well, Jae Dong...

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.720
Just ask me. I'll help you.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.890
Give me his number.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.920
[Seoul bound]
Hey, can't you stay?

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.630
I'll be back soon.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.330
Hey.

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.480
The bus is here. Aren't you getting in?

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.650
Oh, really?

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.510
The bus is here, Hyo Ri. I have to go.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.340
I'll be back soon.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:19.350
What?

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:23.670
Hi.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.010
Hi.

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:28.790
Here. It's for you.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:32.250
These are the Shine Muscats from So Yeon's farm.

00:38:35.508 --> 00:38:38.780
Thank you. T-They look tasty.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.480
Be sure to come back.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.760
Huh?

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.660
I don't have a girlfriend.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.840
What are you doing?

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.960
- Good luck.
- I can't keep hanging out with him.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.080
What are you talking about?

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.680
Hey, see you later.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.560
Yes, come back soon.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.100
- Bye.
- You need to come back.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.260
Let's go.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.670
Hey.

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:20.040
Why are you crying?

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.820
Don't cry. She'll be back.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.090
- Hello.
- Hey, Byeong Jae.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.580
We're closed for lunch. Are you here to eat?

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.670
No. I wanted to bring this back.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.990
Gosh. You could've returned it later.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.290
And...

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:44.820
This, too.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.640
W-What's this?

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.400
It's a poetry book. I thought you'd like it.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.490
Poetry book.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:56.000
"Can you eat it?"

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.210
You like poetry, right?

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:01.800
Poetry?

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.660
Yes, I love it.

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:08.860
She likes poultry, not poetry.

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.640
If you haven't eaten...

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:15.750
No, no. I need to get going.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:17.550
But I don't know about Mr. Ryu.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.530
I told him I was going to Masterpiece.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:21.390
And he said...

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.470
he needed to bring this to Ms. Lee.

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:25.340
Come look. Over here.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.290
Where?

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:30.840
He followed me, but he won't come in.

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:40.880
W-Why won't he come in?

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.710
Does his back hurt?

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.300
You should've come in.
Why are you protesting out here?

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:56.650
Well...

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:00.120
I came to apologize for yesterday.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.250
But pushing that door open was so hard.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:07.380
You must've been flustered, too.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.800
I would've felt better if I had gotten injured.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.610
Lee Ji An.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:16.390
I thought Yeo Jeong was just annoying,

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.100
but she's nice.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:22.660
She's honest, thoughtful, and sincere.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.310
You can judge a person by working with them.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:27.970
She's honest.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.870
She doesn't look like it,
but she can be thoughtful.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:33.600
You feel sorry for her once you know her.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.810
Oppa,

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:44.310
you're a time machine to me. Did you know?

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.040
When I'm with you,

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:50.120
I feel like an 18-year-old all over again.

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:54.890
When I found out Hyo Ri was sick,

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.980
I felt so scared and struggled a lot,

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.760
and you showed up right then.

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:08.780
Because you let me feel like an 18-year-old again,

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:15.100
I was able to pull myself together
as confidently and bravely as I was back then

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.515
without feeling crushed with anxiety.

00:42:18.515 --> 00:42:21.125
So, I feel grateful for you.

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.650
And...

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.370
I care about you.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:36.250
Relationships keep changing.

00:42:37.675 --> 00:42:40.000
If it'd be good for you,

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.265
it'd be nice if you, Yeo Jeong, and Bo Hyeon

00:42:43.265 --> 00:42:46.355
could restore your relationships.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:50.550
Am I overstepping too much?

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.660
Anyway,

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.230
I understand how you feel.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:57.880
Don't worry about me and go.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.040
Yeo Jeong is injured. Don't leave her alone.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.530
I need to get back to work, too.

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:16.950
Because you could've gotten injured, too.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:20.930
I got angry because I was upset about that.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:41.920
Aigoo, how dare that crow fly so low?

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.140
Dalgu, that bastard.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:50.140
He should crow after the sunset,
at least, if not at dawn.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.140
Gosh, look at this bastard.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:04.120
If I'm sitting here like this, he should say,

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.620
"Aigoo, Hyungnim, are you drinking makgeolli?

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:08.220
Should I pour you a glass?"

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.110
That's being polite.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:11.790
He has no basic...

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:14.920
What? Did he hear me?

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.650
I don't think I was that loud.

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.420
We got the onions delivered.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.470
Tae Oh.

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:49.870
Yes?

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:58.680
Hey, that's enough.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.510
What's with you today? You're scaring me.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.290
- Hyung.
- What?

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.650
What did you say just now?

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:16.420
I think I'm broken.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.670
It's okay. It's okay.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:21.140
I was broken a long time ago, too.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:24.840
My battery died a long time ago.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.640
By the way, what did you call me?

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.370
- Hyung!
- Yes.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:33.700
Yes, yes, yes. Jeong Seok.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.820
Are you worried about something?

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.340
Go ahead and tell me everything.

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.850
I might not look like it,

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:44.910
but I was called Sergeant Byeon, the therapist.

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:46.980
I was basically like Oh Eun Young.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.740
I'm serious.

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.940
I'm scared of people.

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:54.500
I'm scared of someone.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.060
Someone...

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.160
is sick.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:04.350
By someone, do you mean love?

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:08.100
I suppose that's the same thing.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:12.380
The unfamiliar feeling I haven't felt for so long

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:17.100
is making my heart creaky.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.190
I'm not sure what's wrong with it.

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:25.710
I think I'm broken.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:29.180
Did something fly into here?

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.740
Does it flutter, creak,

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:34.340
make you run out of breath,

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.420
suddenly flip out like you're crazy,

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.650
and makes you think, "Is this how I die?"

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:41.060
How did you know?

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:45.900
It's an epidemic
from the time of Australopithecus.

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:48.890
It's love.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:54.450
Love.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:58.690
I met my wife when we worked at a shoe factory.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:02.200
I had a crush on her the entire time.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:06.260
But she suddenly stopped coming to the factory.

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.680
I was wondering where she went.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.150
She apparently got married.

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:15.690
Because I was so distressed back then,
I got shorter.

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:19.940
Are you doubting me right now?

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.080
I was almost 180 cm tall.

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.500
I got shorter because of the shock.

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:33.260
I'm metaphorically saying
that's how heartbroken I was.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:35.170
Anyway,

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:39.650
while I was trying to heal after that,

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:42.290
she suddenly came back to the factory.

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:44.550
After her husband passed away.

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:47.110
She showed up looking so skinny.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:49.880
It drove me insane.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.370
My heart shattered.

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:55.840
That's why I made up my mind.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.340
I decided not to be a fool twice.

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:05.070
So, did you sweep her off her feet like this?

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:08.400
Gosh, you seem to get it.

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:13.550
Jeong Seok,

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:16.810
you can't be a fool twice.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:19.390
You must have a reason.

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:22.850
But while acting timidly like this,

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:27.150
will you end up with another heartache?

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:29.980
I don't know how I feel, either.

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:33.700
Is this right? Is this the right person?

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.560
So...

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.200
"My gosh.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:42.420
This must be love." Something like this?

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.480
There's no such thing.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.960
It's just confusing.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.300
It drives you crazy and confuses you.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.700
You don't know what's going on.

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:53.280
You go, "Geez, I'm going crazy."

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:58.870
But that's when you need to decide
and get a hold of your heart

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:03.170
to turn that crazy feeling into love.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:07.000
Can I love again?

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.400
Of course.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.610
Who says love is predetermined?

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:12.670
Love is courage and choice.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.660
That's why you can start over again.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.410
Start over again.

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:06.040
Thank you.

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:09.680
Stop! Get up!

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.140
I don't want to go to work.

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.670
Should we go to the beach?

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:16.000
It tickles. Stop.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.750
Let's stay this way for five minutes.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:23.140
It tickles. It tickles.

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.840
Gosh, stop!

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:47.370
I can start over?

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:03.720
Excuse me.

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.740
Hand me that.

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:26.050
Huh?

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:30.290
Bo Hyeon, you got an email
from the school in Berlin.

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:32.240
- Huh?
- Oh, my.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.670
Goodness.

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:36.430
They're telling you to apply this semester.

00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:38.100
This is great.

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:41.650
If you get in, we can fly together when I go back.

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:44.860
It'd be great if your dad could come briefly, too.

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.220
He can see you settle down

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:48.540
and we can go on trips together, too.

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:52.040
Yes. But this is too sudden.

00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:54.360
Why? It's great.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:58.570
It feels like this was meant to be.

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:00.830
Let's tell your dad when he gets back.

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:04.090
No. He must be at the office, right?

00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:06.540
I'll go see him right now.

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:18.970
Honey, where are you?

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:52.780
Are you going for a walk?

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.890
How's your leg?

00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:59.050
I'm okay.

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:02.060
By the way, this...

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:10.820
See you later. I need to go somewhere now.

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.730
- Yes, Yeo Jeong. Are you okay?
- Yes.

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.930
That's great. Thank you for the wall.

00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:20.690
Gosh, no...

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.310
There's a flower garden now.

00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:38.160
I thought of the mural at Tae Oh's surfing club.

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:41.800
It doesn't even compare to the
flowers your husband planted.

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:47.100
I just tried to express how he wanted
you to live, looking at flowers.

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:59.110
How do you always move me like this?

00:55:00.610 --> 00:55:02.220
Your heart...

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:07.740
must be torn into thousands of pieces, too.

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:12.500
What energy do you have to care for

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:15.260
other people like this?

00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:20.530
Thanks to you,

00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:25.610
flowers are blossoming in my heart, too.

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.530
Just like that day.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:33.270
Thank you.

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:35.560
Thank you.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.820
You, too, Yeo Jeong.

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.050
Thank you.

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.090
Their curriculum is pretty great.

00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:18.990
The landscape design faculty is young.

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:22.880
They're hip and they're still in the industry.

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:27.860
What did Bo Hyeon say?

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.560
The last time I talked to him,

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.790
he asked about it. So, I looked into it.

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:34.750
I just wanted to check if it was possible,

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:37.870
but they say he can apply now.

00:56:37.870 --> 00:56:39.880
He's lucky.

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.000
He asked you to look into it?

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:51.070
If he decides to do it,

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:53.170
why don't you come to Germany

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:57.775
and stay with him for a few months
until he settles down?

00:56:57.775 --> 00:57:00.795
Wouldn't you be on sabbatical soon?

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:09.350
Yeo Jeong.

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.040
Yes?

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.800
You used to...

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:17.330
want to live somewhere with an ocean view.

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:19.610
Do you still like the ocean?

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.960
It always feels special.

00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:31.440
But I don't want to live near the ocean anymore.

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.980
Those places are usually far from hospitals.

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:41.130
We're old now.

00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:42.570
Aren't we?

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:51.370
When Bo Hyeon was in second grade,

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:57.300
I went to Germany for your birthday.

00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.590
To celebrate your birthday.

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.290
Yeo Jeong,

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.730
you can stop now.

00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:26.010
Don't do this.

00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:36.050
Honey,

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:39.540
I understand.

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.290
But no.

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:46.270
Don't let me go like this.

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.680
Yeo Jeong,

00:58:51.850 --> 00:58:53.670
I have...

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:05.410
struggled for too long.

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.570
At first, I couldn't forgive you for betraying me.

00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:16.870
Later, I couldn't forgive myself for running away.

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:23.320
I struggled a lot more

00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:27.660
than you can imagine.

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.230
You were young, too.

00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:36.720
I know you were lonely.

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:43.590
I should've cared for you better.

00:59:43.590 --> 00:59:45.820
You're such a fool.

00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:51.020
You really were a fool, Honey.

00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:55.000
What's with Lee Ji An?

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.510
How does she know everything about you?

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:09.600
I thought I'd regret it if I didn't tell you now.

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:15.540
I like Jeong Seok.

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.340
So?

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.940
So, I wanted to ask you a favor.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:25.400
- Are you asking me to give up-
- Please apologize.

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.920
The day I went to the conference,

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.800
I heard people talking about why you two broke up.

01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:40.950
He's probably blaming himself for that, too.

01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:42.540
Like a fool,

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.820
he must be thinking, "She must've had a reason.

01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.930
What did I do wrong?" while blaming himself.

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:50.750
Because he's a fool,

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.700
he must've struggled alone for a long time.

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.940
Oppa doesn't know that I know.

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:04.020
He doesn't need to be comforted right now.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:07.467
He needs an apology.
And only you can do that to him.

01:01:07.467 --> 01:01:09.508
So, please do that for me.

01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:14.340
You're overstepping your bounds now.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.040
I'm not overstepping.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:22.270
Because I like him and care about him,

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:24.800
I'm giving up.

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.090
So, he's not confused,

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.390
I'm stepping aside.

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:34.730
I'm sorry.

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:37.440
I'm sorry.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:46.583
I know what you did for me
and for Bo Hyeon. I know better than anyone.

01:01:46.583 --> 01:01:48.983
I shouldn't have done that.

01:01:51.690 --> 01:01:53.320
I'm sorry.

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:01.930
It's entirely my fault that we broke up.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:06.420
You shouldn't carry this burden.

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:10.640
Unload everything on me

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.990
and be at peace now.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.260
To be honest,

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:28.600
I knew the moment I first saw Ji An.

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:34.320
I knew it was too late, but I wanted to try.

01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:38.890
I wouldn't have given up if it weren't for Ji An.

01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:41.960
But it's...

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.680
impossible for me to beat her.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.920
Oh, my God!

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.580
What? What? What?

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.740
Is something going on?

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.670
No.

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:21.830
What do you mean, no?

01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:24.580
You look as if the world has ended.

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:29.770
I know why.

01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:32.310
Is it because of the store's profit?

01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:33.950
To settle down at first-

01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:36.010
No, Dr. Jung.

01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:39.230
She's in love with someone right now.

01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:42.300
But she met a powerful enemy, who is his ex-wife.

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.200
While naively playing nice,

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.480
she's about to lose him now.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.280
Is that true?

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.800
Hey, seriously.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.160
Hey. Aigoo...

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:55.460
You'd better get away from those two.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.310
Birds of a feather flock together.

01:03:57.310 --> 01:04:00.190
Because they're just like each other,
they got married, divorced,

01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:01.550
- and get back together.
- Come on.

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:02.940
That's what they're doing.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.760
He's not like that.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.700
Ryu Jeong Seok is the worst, okay?

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:10.840
Whether it's romance or lust,
they should keep it to themselves.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:14.570
Why would he shake you up like this?

01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:17.270
It's not his fault that I like him.

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:19.800
You're the bad guy, then?

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.450
They're just living their lives,
but you turned them into bad people.

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:28.540
Hey, are you trying to win
the Nobel Peace Prize or something?

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:32.130
Whatever. How frustrating. Forget it.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:40.965
Lee Ji An, can you handle it?

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.110
If you can love until the end, get up now.

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:47.550
Go and tell him.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.120
Tell him to be yours.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.680
That's what I'm saying!

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:55.290
Hey, you bitch. That's what I'm saying right now.

01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:57.850
Stop this pity party and go now.

01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:00.465
Go and say, "Oppa, sleep with me."

01:05:00.465 --> 01:05:03.935
No, hold on. "Live with me!"

01:05:09.695 --> 01:05:14.960
It's not like that. You don't have to worry.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.160
What's wrong with you? Seriously.

01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:20.970
You aren't inferior to Bo Hyeon's mom.

01:05:20.970 --> 01:05:23.470
They broke up, anyway.

01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:26.510
You're more shameless, dogged,

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:30.600
and you and Jeong Seok
are each other's first love.

01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:35.550
I told you not to be fearful of fate.

01:05:35.550 --> 01:05:39.610
That we shouldn't hide behind
a plausible reason and run away.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.530
You're Lee Ji An.

01:05:43.530 --> 01:05:46.020
