The Imperial Hospital has tried everything

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.960
but could not find
the source of the poison.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.360
We could only detect
a scent of ancient wood

in the blood His Majesty coughed up.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.030

that night at Xuanji Pavilion,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.700
it was also the Justice Bureau
who sent signals to break in.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.650
It seemed like they were protecting
the late empress,

but in fact, they surrounded her.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.560
And when you led your troops
into Xuanji Pavilion,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.889
it appeared to be a coup,

I knew you would figure out
the whole picture.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.190
That night, I received a secret order
from the late empress,

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.850
commanding me to bring my troops
to Xuanji Pavilion for a meeting.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.170
If it was just a meeting,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.950
why would I need to bring troops?

I sensed something was terribly wrong.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.690
Upon arriving at Xuanji Pavilion,
I discovered

The late empress was trapped

knew she had to quickly
dismantle the noble families' plot.

For the noble families,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.000
it merely meant
replacing one puppet with another.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.860
On the surface,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.220
we would still appear to be
controlled by the noble families,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.770

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.880
to protect the throne.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.880
Therefore, I hereby write this decree

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.170
to clear his name.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.770
This is...

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.090
Hoping future generations will understand
his true intentions.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:49.990
Impossible.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:52.480
This is impossible.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.140
You should be very familiar with
the late empress's handwriting.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.330
All these years, His Majesty

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.770
had been fulfilling
the late empress's wishes.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.240
It was you and Qin Qiu
who stirred up trouble,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.440
conspiring together

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.730
and plunging Dacang into chaos!

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.880
It was you,

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.990
who betrayed the late empress,

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:13.920
betrayed Dacang,

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.270
and betrayed His Majesty!

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.400
This is impossible!

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
You even betrayed yourself as well.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.460
This absolutely can't be.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.349
You're...

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.220
You're trying to deceive me
with this delaying tactic.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.440
So it was really me

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.520
who killed him with my own hands.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.480
Yin Cong, tell me.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:47.670
Was His Majesty's poisoning

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.990
related to your brush holder?

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:53.910
Yes.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.550
But why am I unharmed?

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.350
Why him specifically?

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.680
Why?

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.810
It would only take effect when taken with
the black tea His Majesty drank.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.260
How cruel you are.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.480
I've been tolerating your hostility

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.010
and prejudice against His Majesty
all along.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.920
Is this what my tolerance has earned me?

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.550
Yin Cong.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.790
Today, our friendship

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.030
ends here.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.110
Yin Changyan is truly dead.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.030
Arrest that sinful woman Su

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.190
and find the prince!

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:00.790
Yes!

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.510
Grand Preceptor, we've searched
the entire palace

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.310
but found no trace of the prince.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:26.110
It seems that kid has been sent away.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.790
However, with Prince Qi in my hands,

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.960
that kid is no longer a threat.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.960
Relay my orders.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:40.590
Empress Su poisoned His Majesty

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.680
and plotted to usurp the throne.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.940
She has been arrested.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.110
Throw her into the imperial prison
immediately

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.500
to await further orders!

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.020
Yes!

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.000
Move.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.550
The great cause is complete.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.360
This realm will soon be entirely
in my hands.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.820
[Justice Bureau]

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.570
I heard Your Majesty is skilled at Go.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.160
May I have the honor of
learning a thing or two from you?

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.750
The art of Go

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.840
requires careful planning
and control of the entire board.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.960
When it comes to ruthlessness
and scheming,

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.590
I, Leyu, pale in comparison.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.860
Your strategy has left you

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.600
with your brother dead,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.070
His Majesty gone,

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.590
and yourself imprisoned.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.820
In this game of Go,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.170
Your Majesty has lost miserably.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.750
Grand Preceptor,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.350
the game isn't over yet.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.240
How can you be so certain?

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.280
Yin Cong cannot save you,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.200
and neither can Yin Zhiyi.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:26.350
What's before you now

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.830
is a lost game.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.730
I am different from you, Grand Preceptor.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.340
You're in the game,
yet merely a pawn yourself.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.720
However, you foolishly attempt

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.250
to use others as your pawns.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.540
But people and pawns
are fundamentally different.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.210
The one who plays

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.570
must know how to employ each wisely.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.830
Yet people are not pawns.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.110
How could they be compared to
a mere game of Go?

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.370
If you always treat others as pawns,

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.880
one day,

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.380
you'll find yourself trapped
in your own deadly game.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.400
In the end,

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.990
the pawns will turn against you,

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.350
and you will lose everything.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.320
Well said.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.750
Very well.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.490
Then I shall see

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.600
what kind of strategy Your Majesty has.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.790
Lu.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.960
I appreciate talent.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.240
A wise man should know
when to bend with the wind.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.920
I, Lu Jiuzhang, am old,

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:18.200
and my legs are weak.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.910
Facing traitors and rebels,

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:21.680
I cannot kneel.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.470
Kill me if you wish.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.720
I'm at your mercy.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.860
No need for further words!

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.390
Qin Qiu, you traitor!

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.480
Qin Qiu, you traitor!

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.820
May you rot in hell!

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.960
Rot in hell!

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.150
Once I finish dealing with
that treacherous woman today,

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.350
I'll have you traitors
dragged to the execution grounds.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.720
Bring that treacherous woman here!

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.160
Your Majesty.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.480
Your Majesty.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:56.550
Su Leyu.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.640
You're audacious beyond measure,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.570
plotting for power,
trying to usurp the throne,

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.240
and poisoning His Majesty to death!

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.570
Do you admit your guilt?

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:04.930
He who has a mind to beat his dog

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.590
will easily find his stick.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.110
So you don't admit it?

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.570
You were alone with His Majesty
in Ningzheng Hall,

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:12.880
and by the time we arrived for his rescue,

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.280
His Majesty was already poisoned to death.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.300
If not you, then who else could it be?

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.270
For his rescue?

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.760
You were clearly staging a coup.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.340
The truth is like
a flickering candlelight.

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.020
Who can truly see it clearly?

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.150
The verdict is final.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:44.810
I, Qin Qiu,

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.060
respectfully request Your Highness,
Prince Qi,

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.760
to follow heaven's will

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.820
and ascend the throne.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.090
Follow heaven's will

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.040
and ascend the throne!

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.820
Your Highness.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.310
His Majesty has passed away.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.350
Since ancient times,
the younger brother succeeds

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.830
when the elder passes.
This is the ancient law and ritual.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:12.160
I hope Your Highness
will follow heaven's will

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.000
and take the throne, Prince Qi.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.700
Her Majesty always says
your heart is pure,

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.610
untainted by worldly matters.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.330
If Your Highness can
stay true to yourself,

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:25.660
there may still be hope.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.020
I believe Your Highness
can discern right from wrong

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.220
and see through the clouds to the truth.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.200
Qin Qiu.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.690
As a minister of Dacang,

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.750
instead of working for the welfare of
our state and the people,

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.400
you committed treason.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.360
Three years ago at Xuanji Pavilion,

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.400
you attempted to
force the late empress to abdicate.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.660
And now, you're plotting treason again.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.670
You've really lost all conscience!

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:02.950
-So that's the truth.
-So it was him.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.810
I never would have suspected him.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.680
Qin Qiu!

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:08.610
You traitor!

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.590
Confess your crimes
and submit to justice now!

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.440
You've completely abandoned
all human decency!

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.300
Your Highness.

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.290
These wild accusations of yours,

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.780
I simply don't understand any of them.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:21.670
As a noble prince,

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.500
how could I be held hostage by a traitor?

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.920
I, Yin Zhiyi,

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.700
will never submit, even unto death!

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.580
"Never submit, even unto death?"

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.010
Can't you see the situation we're in?

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:38.410
Go die!

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.200
Look out!

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.030
Qin Qiu!

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:41.240
Leyu!

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.040
Leyu!

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.840
Nobody move!

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.260
Su Leyu.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.410
Today, I will make you bleed
right where you stand!

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:51.400
Report!

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.110
Marquis Jingyuan, Su Wencheng,
has brought troops

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.070
and surrounded the palace!

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.600
Su Wencheng is still alive?

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.610
His Majesty and I
had long seen through your plot

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.440
and secretly sent people
to escort my brother into the city.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.970
When Prince Qi suddenly
returned to Zhongdu,

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.000
I suspected

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:09.110
that you, Grand Preceptor,
must be plotting something,

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.000
so I secretly gathered the imperial guards

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.660
and sent you the false news
of my brother's death

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.310
as preparation for today.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:20.070
What a clever strategy,

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.240
creating a diversion
while executing the real plan.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:25.110
Grand Preceptor,

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.200
in this game of Go now,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.920
who holds

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.880
the winning hand?

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.880
Now that I have you, Su Leyu, in my grasp,

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.830
even with thousands of troops
at his command,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.400
Su Wencheng wouldn't dare
make a rash move.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:48.040
There's a rule of our Su family:

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.000
never rescue hostages.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.960
I don't believe
Su Wencheng will just watch you die.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.890
Everyone, listen to my orders!

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.960
Take Su Leyu

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.960
and defend the palace gates at all costs!

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.590
Yes!

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.850
As expected, womanly compassion

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.100
is unfit for important tasks!

Qin Qiu.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.040
I've served you my entire life.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.150
But today,
I refuse to be your accomplice anymore!

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:23.490
Leyu.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:25.900
As for what I owe you,

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.420
what I owe the late empress,

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.880
and what I owe His Majesty,

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:32.450
I shall repay it all today.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.590
Yin Cong!

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.050
Kill them!

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:51.650
Throw this traitor

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:54.830
into the death prison,

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.300
and execute him by slow slicing!

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:02.320
Heaven wants me dead.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.360
Heaven wants me dead!

Yin Cong.

I'm sorry.

Gallop...

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.660
Gallop freely.

All things in this world are predestined.

Trials of love and hate are merely
illusions in this fleeting life,

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:46.720
so open your heart
and follow the natural way.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.440
Only then will you find inner peace.

The universe is vast.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:56.350
The faithful will surely
find their own place in it.

As for this ordeal,

we've finally made it through.

children from humble families,

regardless of gender,

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.590
may pursue education
and take the imperial examinations

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.520
to serve as government officials.

once the new emperor comes of age,

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:49.480
I will

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.880
return the power to him.

We ministers will spare no effort

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.590
to support the new policies,

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.920
devote ourselves to Dacang,

Remember this.

Most officials in this world

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:42.530
only look down as they walk,

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.410

is to give those
who dare to look up at the sky

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.800
