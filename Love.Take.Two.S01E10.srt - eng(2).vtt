[Nature is a Masterpiece]
Oppa, I like you.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.570
Don't try hard anymore.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.430
I'll run to you.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.920
Gosh, what was that?

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.460
Didn't you fall asleep watching a TV drama?

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.650
Mr. Ryu said something like that?

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.100
That makes no sense.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.300
I'm telling you.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.760
It does make sense.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.330
You scared me.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.260
Yesterday, Jeong Seok called me Hyung and...

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.150
asked me about love.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.350
So, I taught him.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.400
"Jeong Seok, love is
about decisiveness and courage."

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.840
Gosh, you were drinking makgeolli early yesterday.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.680
Have you not sobered up yet?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.130
Mr. Ryu called you "Hyung," you said?

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.870
Come on.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.470
He probably was like, "Hey, Byeon."

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.140
I'm telling you.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.950
Jeong Seok called me Hyung and-

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.370
Hold on. Be quiet for a moment.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.400
So, what happened next?

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.680
That's the important part. What happened?

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.180
- So...
- Yes.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.970
- Then...
- Yes.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.980
Mr. Ryu...

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.000
held Ji An's waist like this...

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.180
Oh, my. Oh, my.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.560
- Tightly.
- Oh, my God.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.190
I'm sorry I hesitated.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.600
I'm sorry, I was indecisive.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.400
- Did they kiss?
- That part is important.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.560
- Yes. Did they?
- Auntie.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.700
Hi, Hyo Ri. Going somewhere?

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.100
To Bo Hyeon's farm.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.090
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.530
- Bye now.
- Okay, okay.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.120
- Bye.
- See you.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.560
Love is in the air in this village.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.370
She should've kissed-

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.080
Hold on. Hold on.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.680
Look, look. Over there.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.320
Aren't they Ji An and Mr. Ryu?

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.880
They're coming. They're coming. Sit. Sit.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.610
You came.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.370
Hey, you came.

00:03:05.223 --> 00:03:12.000
Gosh, he escorted her
as if she's Marie Antoinette.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.010
What is he, an automatic door?
Why does he keep opening doors?

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.670
Well, you know...

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.850
I witnessed something yesterday.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.380
So, I was doing a morning briefing.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.700
What did you see?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.810
I don't know. What did I see, Mr. Ryu?

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.590
Do I have to know that?

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.380
Should I bring you coffee?
I got good beans for the office.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.380
No. I don't drink coffee on an empty stomach.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.610
Okay. I'll pick you up when you go to the studio.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.410
Have a good day.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.510
You said he called you Hyung.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.500
Say, "Jeong Seok."

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.450
Jeong Seok.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.080
- How dare you call him like that?
- Pardon?

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.540
Gosh, Mr. Ryu. Have a good day today.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.955
It wasn't me, Hyung.

00:03:57.955 --> 00:03:59.920
It really wasn't me.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:00.702
I really...

00:04:00.702 --> 00:04:02.080
Hyung! Hyung...

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.300
Why blame an innocent person? Why?

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.880
It's over. It's okay.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.680
- What do you mean, it's okay?
- Aigoo...

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.050
Of course, he didn't call you Hyung.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.860
Gosh, whatever. We hung out enough.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.020
Let's leave now.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.890
Gosh, thank you for the morning briefing.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.980
See you.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.600
Thank you for the useful information.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.100
Come again. Please come again.

00:04:28.973 --> 00:04:34.850
There's no scientific report
on anyone's face changing this much overnight.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.335
I know. Is your waist okay?

00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:42.215
According to a report,
your back was severely bent last night.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.290
Let's start if you're done teasing me for the day.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.890
Hey.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.570
Why didn't you kiss?

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.440
You should've put a seal on him.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.640
You think I didn't this morning
just because I didn't last night?

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.350
Did you?

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.070
You did.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.680
You think I'd tell you?

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.390
Please tell me just once.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.430
Ji An, I'm curious.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.310
Ji An, did you?

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.370
With your lips?

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.930
Did you not? Are you imagining it?

Do you know we're going on a trip next week?

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.070
- Huh?
- You said you haven't traveled much.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.140
Let's go together.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.400
Look.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.740
I looked up the places we can go to nearby.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.770
Next Wednesday and Thursday will be perfect.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.900
I'm off work then.

By the way, where are we taking a trip to?

We aren't going anywhere.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.660
Don't resist.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.010
You think Ms. Lee would let you two go alone?

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.310
No.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.580
What do you do, then?

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.210
I have no choice but to come with you.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.300
We aren't going.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.480
I think we are.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.800
We aren't. I hate taking trips.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.050
Yes. Our ancestors said...

you suffer when you leave home for a reason.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.600
The ancestors were so nosy.

Guys, should we go to a theme park?

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.120
- This is tasty.
- I know.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.600
You didn't eat it.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.400
I should try it. We need chopsticks to eat.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.660
- Use your hands for pancakes.
- No, Hyung.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.720
- Hyo Ri, should we go on a restaurant tour?
- Aigoo, it's okay.

Hold on.

Let's go as soon as possible.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.390
Okay. By the way,

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.110
as Tae Oh Said, if we tell our parents,

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.920
they'd tell us to go with him.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.710
No, that... that can never happen.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.070
I know. I totally agree.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:06.380

except for Ahjumma and Dad.

Okay.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.260
Right.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.030
Do you know about my mom and Ahjussi?

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.250
Yes. Dong Seok heard from Grandma Mi Mi.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.980
He told me all the unnecessary details.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.370
Is your mom okay?

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.770
What about you?

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.590
I'm totally separated from their romance.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.710
So, I'll respect no matter
what decision they make.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.800
I see.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.040
Anyway, let's get back on the topic.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.900
I found a museum and a book cafe to go to.

Come visit me sometime.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.500
Let's go on dates and stuff.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.740
Are you feeling okay?

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.700
I'm not okay yet.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.810
But I'll slowly...

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.300
I'll slowly feel better.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.130
Bo Hyeon,

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.400
do you know what I regret the most?

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.045
That I couldn't...

00:09:42.045 --> 00:09:44.425
be honest sooner.

00:09:45.915 --> 00:09:50.165
I always felt bad for you and Dad,

00:09:50.165 --> 00:09:52.815
but I couldn't be honest about it.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.000
When you needed me,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.470
I couldn't be by your side. I'm sorry.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.250
I haven't been able to,

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.680
but from now on, at any given day, at any moment,

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.850

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.360
I'll be waiting for you.

during those moments when I needed you,

00:10:33.435 --> 00:10:35.005
I'll...

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.830
I'll come to you at my own pace.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.830
No, it's not. It's scorching.

No, it's nice. Okay?

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.840
So,

No.

Yeah. I'm going on a weekday, too.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.180

When?

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.130
Next week. Next week sometime.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.890
So, when next week? When?

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.170
I'm screwed.

Am I the only one who thinks
it was a strange conversation?

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.100
Gosh, I have a hunch.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.350

We have no clue.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.680
So pretty.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.650
I love it.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:03.240
Okay. I love it.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:06.630
Do the flower stem. The flower stem.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:08.280
Flower stem. Flower stem.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.830
Nice.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:11.070
Let's take photos of you now.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.430
Okay, okay. Here.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.770
Oppa, laugh, laugh.

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.170
Laugh.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.770
What's that?

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.540
You can't be both handsome and cute.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.180
Cute, cute.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.340
Nice. Nice.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.130
My gosh.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.970
I like this pose.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.980
It's cool. Can we do this?

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.620
Should we try? Okay.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.610
- It's working. It's working.
- Really?

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:46.470
- Hold still.
- Like this?

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.090
Okay, okay.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.760
Hold on. Wait.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.250
Together?

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.500
One, two, three.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.490
Got it.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.320
- Wow.
- Did it work?

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.670
It looks great. It looks great.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.370
We look pretty good.

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:13.860
You're a good photographer.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.760
Gosh, no.

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.570
So, that's how I smile.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:27.130
You smile the same way you did
when you were a kid.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:36.670
You're extremely pure, I guess?

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.620
It's because I'm with you.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.640
I smile like this because I'm with you.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:48.750
I learned that I smile like this,
thanks to you, too.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.580
Why do you flirt without a warning?

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.310
You got me flustered.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.720
If so,

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.160
since I'm flustered, let me...

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:06.290
suggest an idea for our next date.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.110
Whoa, I'm excited.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:09.640
What is it?

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.030
Ramen.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.850
Ramen?

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.480
Ji An,

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.670
do you want to eat ramen
at my house and sleep over?

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:34.120
I have no choice since we decided
to enjoy ourselves proudly.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.690
Okay.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.860
Right now? Right now?

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.950
- Huh?
- Can we go now?

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.120
Well, right now? Well... wait...

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.890
Hey...

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.450
It's my house. You need to wait for me.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.730
Why is she so good on her bike?

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.000
Wait for me!

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.700
Here they come. Brace yourselves.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.950
What's the theme of the day?

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.310
It's "E.T." It's "E.T."

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.380
Today's theme is "Roman Holiday."

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.320
Right?

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:26.490
Wow. You make a single lady feel sad.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:29.370
Why do you have to show off to everyone

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.310
and say, "We're dating"? How obnoxious.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.770
And are you copying me?

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:39.510
How could I not show off
when my boyfriend is this handsome?

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:41.800
We'll keep showing off from now on.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.200
Please hang out as a group like this often.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.000
- Let's go, babe.
- Okay.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.350
Wait for me, babe.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.040
Did they both have a heat stroke?

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.730
- So sweet.
- I can't believe this.

Are you smitten?

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.440
What?

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.460
I was like a Siren, wasn't I?

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.220
What?

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.320
You weren't quite on that level, to be honest.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.400
- Listen again.
- Okay, okay.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.750
My almost Siren,

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.470
let's go eat. You must be hungry.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:00.890
Let go.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.506
You can't sing in front of
other men the rest of your life.

00:32:06.506 --> 00:32:10.656

It's surprising.

You try it, too.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:04.050

Okay.

Hey.

Did you pack everything okay?

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:29.840
Yes.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.110
Hyo Ri, I called you to tell you to hit his nose.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:34.490
What?

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:36.390
Hit his nose if you need to.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.520
You know consent and respect are crucial, right?

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.450
Don't hesitate and tell him if you think it's off.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:44.740
Beat him up if he doesn't listen, okay?

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.750
Well, that's...

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.600
Okay.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.510
Shit. Why is my heart pounding?

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:56.480
Hey, I think I lost my sense of taste
because I'm nervous.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.650
The pasta tasted like nothing.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.060
That's nuts. Are you eating? You want a potbelly?

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.650
Just pretend to eat.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.390

That's great. Eat more of mine.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.360
I'm not that hungry.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.830

Here.

Let's poke.

Poke?

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.230
You got indigestion. I need to poke your finger.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:03.120
You're poking with a needle,
instead of a medical treatment?

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.730
Do you want a medical treatment?

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:08.020
Yes. I don't want stuff like this-

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:12.800

I teared up just now.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:23.310
I learned this medical treatment
from Dr. Heo Jun, okay?

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.070
What do we do? This is our first trip.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.450
I'm sorry.

Don't say stuff like that.

So refreshing.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:15.260
Did Bo Hyeon tell you that
he was taking a trip with Hyo Ri?

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.480
He said he was going to a seminar in Seoul,

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.140
and he got all decked out.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.020
He washed his car the day before, too.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.820
I just knew something was up.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:32.240
Don't you feel uncomfortable about them dating?

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.290
Why would I?

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:37.240
I mean, Hyo Ri... You know.

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:43.340
I just trust Bo Hyeon.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:46.540
And I like Hyo Ri.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:53.370
You don't know that your
decisions are special, right?

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:56.130
People usually don't make the same decisions.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.020
But you make them like they're nothing sometimes.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:03.970
Even though you can avoid them
if you feel uncomfortable.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:07.580
I know you're a special person like that.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.200
That's why I like you.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.150
Was that a confession or a monologue?

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:15.810
I was flirting.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.050
Look at you. You're acting cute now.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:19.840
Was it cute? Was it cute?

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.030
Should I do more of it?

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:22.770
Bboo-ing. Bboo-ing.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:24.680
- Right back at you.
- Right back at you.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.780
Right back at you.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:26.870
Right back at you.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.860
Right back at you.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.990
Right back at you.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.240
Right back at you!

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.630
- Oppa.
- Yeah?

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:43.460
I said we're turning 50 soon.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.190
What's wrong with you?

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.980
Hey, hey. Come here. Come here!

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.150
Oh, no. Stop, stop!

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.050
I have no mercy.

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:55.590
Stop now! Stop. Stop.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.280
What are these?

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.010
Laundry. It's my laundry.

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.470
It doesn't look like it. Hold on.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.740
What?

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.530
A-Are these matching pajamas?

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:16.590
Well, y-you need them t-to sleep over.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.370
S-So, you bought matching pajamas?

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.050
To match with me?

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:24.490
Hey, don't wear them
if you don't want them. Don't.

00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:27.150
I can just wear them alone.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:30.400
Gosh, he's really...

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.430
He's more aggressive than he seems.

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.260
You're so sly.

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.300
As if you've been waiting for this day.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.370
It's not that. As I said,

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.220
since my blood type is A, and I'm a Capricorn,

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.790
I'm sensitive and deliberate.

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:47.480
I swear I'm not a sly person.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.340
Oppa,

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.870
I'm not easy to read.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.330
I'm as difficult to read as ancient literature.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:58.720
I'm like Encyclopedia Britannica, then.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:02.560
By the way,

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.400
do we need pajamas?

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.540
I don't think you need to wear them, either.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.180
I love pajamas.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:15.000
I'll wear them both
if you don't want to wear them.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:20.370
What?

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.560
By the way,

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:28.550
why...

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:32.560
d-do you not need to wear them?

00:39:36.853 --> 00:39:38.433
I don't know...

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:05.200
You're pretty.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.290
It's nighttime. It's nighttime.

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.040
It's nighttime.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.390
What? Are you sick?

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.030
No.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:06.710
I feel alive.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.840
Yes. You look okay.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:18.510
This was our first trip.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:21.050
But I zonked out.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:25.340
It's okay.

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.830
Should we go out?

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:31.150
Should we?

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:32.970
Let's.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:34.660
Okay.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.190
We need to go out, but...

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:45.010
I know.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.670
Wow. It's delicious.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:28.830
Is it because the view is nice?

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.920
Is that so?

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:38.550
I'm embarrassed. Stop looking at me.

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:40.130
Look forward. Look forward.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:43.480
- Huh?
- Look forward.

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.910
Okay.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:51.030
Are the kids having fun? They aren't calling.

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:55.900
You must feel okay.

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.330
A former med student sure is different.

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:00.400
You looked so skilled at poking my finger.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:03.210
- I'm all healed now.
- Really?

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:04.610
Yes.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:11.280
After I learned I was sick, I quit
medical school, saying it's not for me.

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:14.590
Maybe I shouldn't have.

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.660
But I think differently now.

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.830
Watching you, So Yeon,

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:22.180
and the rest of the guys,

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.600
I wanted to live according to
my thoughts, not the other way around.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:30.720
Instead of stopping blindly,

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.600
maybe I should've asked,
"How do I want to live?" first.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.000
So, I keep thinking...

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.740
about what I really want.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:47.500
You'll definitely find it, but it'd take time.

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:51.790
You need to collect the wrong answers one by one

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:54.810
to find your own answer.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.770
But I'm still collecting wrong answers, too.

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:07.110
What?

00:45:09.247 --> 00:45:16.673
Since you're by my side
and my mom is living her life now,

00:45:16.673 --> 00:45:18.203
I...

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.250
I want to live.

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:28.750
I want to live well.

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.350
Don't worry. You will.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.870
It's raining.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.230
Huh? It's raining.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:47.760
Huh? Let's go inside...

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:07.860
I said you'll walk flowery paths
if you follow me, right?

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:14.840
Was having someone to cover me in the rain

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.530
so heart-fluttering like this?

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.130
Are you tired?

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.930
Should we go inside?

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:27.340
Why, Ji An? What's wrong?

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.020
Why am I so happy?

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:33.530
I'm not used to feeling nothing but happiness.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.870
It doesn't feel like it belongs to me.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:42.060
This is all yours.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.700
I know.

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:11.590
- Aren't you cold?
- Huh?

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:13.750
I'm not cold at all.

00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:19.420
Hyo Ri,

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.415
let's enjoy romantic feelings for the first time

00:47:22.415 --> 00:47:25.655
by doing things we can do, like this.

00:47:26.605 --> 00:47:28.790
Even if you have sad memories,

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:32.625
if you remember romantic ones as well,

00:47:32.625 --> 00:47:34.965
the sad ones will end up

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:40.900
being replaced by romantic ones.

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:47.330
Replacement of memories.

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:51.770
Let's do that.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:59.300
We can decide what we'll end up
remembering in the end.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.640
It stopped raining.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:20.930
Crunchy peaches.

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:23.280
Should we make peach mul kimchi with these?

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.550
Look. Look at this huge chicken.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.640
That's a duck. A duck.

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:33.050
It's tasty, right? This is a secret spot.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.780
If you visit the market sometimes

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.490
and look at different ingredients,

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.960
you get new menu ideas.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.190
You learn how to choose ingredients
by talking to the merchants, too.

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:55.820
I see. This is so fun.

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.340
Invite me next time, too.

00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.070
Should I?

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:01.210
Okay.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:06.010
Where does your family live?

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:07.850
Do you know Jangsu-dong?

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:08.870
Yes.

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:11.950
They live in Olympic Apartments there.
That's where I grew up.

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.810
You lived in a nice place.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.350
Hey.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:25.100
See your mother today.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.320
I made side dishes
with the greens I got yesterday.

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.170
Take this with you.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:35.760
No, I'm not-

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.540
People's feelings change day after day.

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:49.250
Because of the built-up feelings,
true feelings keep getting buried.

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:52.850
But that doesn't change how you really feel.

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:55.350
You become so wistful whenever
you talk about your mom.

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:57.660
Why do you suffer alone?

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.630
Let's go.

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:04.090
Okay? Go and tell her that you missed her.

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:11.280
Let's go.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:49.480
Long time no see.

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:54.400
Mom doesn't feel comfortable seeing you.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.620
I told you.

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:58.450
That's why I came to see you.

00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:01.180
She doesn't want to see you.

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.830
- Later, I'll-
- No.

00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:06.710
I need to hear it myself today.

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:08.170
Hey.

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.890
You're always like this.

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:16.230
You do everything however you want.

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:18.170
You haven't changed.

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:21.420
Did you quit drinking?

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:25.500
Aren't you still drinking?

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:32.320
Yes, I've been well. Are you in good health?

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.870
We're still a family.

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.800
I thought I should ask how you are.

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:44.400
Your brother's been keeping me updated
about you. You don't-

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:48.200
Mom, I said I know.

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.480
I know I ruined both of our lives.

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.630
I'm sorry.

00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:59.720
But could you forgive me now?

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.850
You're having a hard time, too.

00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:05.670
You remind me of the past.

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:08.330
You make things even harder!

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.050
Gosh.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:18.410
Geez. What a shitty life.

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:23.390
So what if I hurt myself? So what?

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.680
I won't live for that long.

00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:46.120
I-I want to live the rest of my life...

00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:49.540
in peace.

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:27.590
Why did you come out so soon?

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.480
I don't think she's home.

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.340
I see.

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.970
I'll get a coffee at a cafe nearby.

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:46.940
- Okay.
- I don't want to get drowsy while driving.

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:49.500
It might take some time. Wait for me.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.200
- Okay. Take your time.
- Okay.

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:28.430
Why don't you just be honest with Tae Oh?

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:32.710
