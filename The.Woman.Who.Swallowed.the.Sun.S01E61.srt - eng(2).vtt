WEBVTT

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.610
Mr. Jo!

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.610
Mr. Jo!

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.910
Mr. Jo.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.020
Mr. Jo.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.050
Mr. Jo!

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.650
Mr. Jo, come on, wake up!

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.490
Mr. Jo!

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.830
Mr. Jo, wake up! Mr. Jo!

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.030
Hey! Mr. Jo!

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.200
Mr. Jo!

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.370
Mr. Jo!

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.610
You should enjoy being this happy today.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.580
All the evil things you've done,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.590
you'll be paying for them soon enough.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.870
I barely got through that wedding.
Darn it.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.410
Who knew I'd live to see my own
father-in-law's wedding?

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.680
It's all in how you look at it.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.010
People live to 100 now. He's not that old.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.480
And getting remarried
is hardly news anymore.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.320
Hey, that's not cool.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.560
I don't know what you were thinking
pushing for this ridiculous wedding,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.420
but it'll come back to haunt you.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.400
What's done is done.
I just hope they move out.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.630
This is Dad's house.
We're the ones living under his roof.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.500
We need to get our facts straight.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.940
Exactly. Once Dad and Mom move in,
we'll be the outsiders.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.510
Calling her "Mom" just rolls right
off your tongue, doesn't it?

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.820
Oh, dear.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.760
Have a seat.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.900
I told you we should've gone
to a nice resort to relax.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.770
Some other time.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.200
Who ever heard of a honeymoon
that's just one night in a city hotel?

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.070
Actually, my original plan was
to skip this and go straight home.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.780
So unromantic.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.980
What, you couldn't wait another day
to live with me?

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.880
Couldn't you tell?

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.980
What would I have done
if we hadn't gotten married?

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.770
I hear some grooms carry their new brides
up the hotel stairs.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.740
It's a shame
this old groom can't do that for you.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.740
There's nothing to feel bad about.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.440
Nobody does that anymore.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.680
Instead of following old trends,
we can just do things our own way.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.260
Hold on.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.750
Oh my.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.750
Why am I suddenly so tired?

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.990
What's happening to me?

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.870
Chairman?

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.400
What?

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.300
Gosh.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.040
- Oh my.
- Wake up.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.760
My head hurts.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.320
So, you're finally awake?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.160
What happened? When did you get up?

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.060
I can't remember a thing about last night.
What's wrong with me?

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.500
Last night, did I...

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.000
No, let me...

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.440
Our courtship was short,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.610
and we had our share of ups and downs.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.610
Honestly, it feels like I've been
through a war.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.580
Well, that's true.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.180
But last night, did I...

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.890
I want to be a good wife to you.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.630
I may not be your first love,
but I want to be your last.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.500
Is that too much to ask?

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.460
Why would that be too much to ask?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.130
What, are you worried
I'll start seeing other women?

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.300
Is that a promise?

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.610
Then that's all I need.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.280
I trust you.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.010
Please change into these.
You can wear something comfortable.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.680
I wore a Hanbok because I wanted
to look like a new bride.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.290
The Hanbok looks lovely on you.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.590
- But by any chance, last night, did I...
- Get changed and come out.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.290
I'll go take care of the checkout.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.210
Last night,

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.680
as your woman,

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.240
I was truly happy.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.350
Really?

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.560
Why can't I remember anything? Gosh.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.330
I guess so.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.400
Why haven't I heard from you?
You said you'd call.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.570
You're not my only case, you know.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.200
I can't just focus on you.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.510
How can you be so nonchalant
about a murder investigation?

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.880
And someone is dead.

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.650
How is there not one news story about it?
What the heck are the reporters doing?

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.220
"Nonchalant?"

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.490
Who's being nonchalant?

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.960
What a ridiculous thing to say.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.930
And another thing.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.160
Isn't it obvious why there are no stories
in the papers or online?

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.700
To be blunt, a homeless guy died.
That's hardly front-page news.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.800
What did you just say?
"Some homeless guy?"

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.110
Do you have any idea how many
violent crime cases we're dealing with?

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.280
Just wait. I told you I'd call.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.910
Jo Pil Doo's death wasn't an accident.
It was murder!

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.280
We're investigating cases
in the order they came in,

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:33.050
so you'll have to wait.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.590
How long do you expect me to wait?

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:35.920
Hello?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.320
Hello?

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.300
- Ma'am!
- Se Ri.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.940
Why are you still calling her that?

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.310
Oh, right. My bad.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.550
You're home.

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.080
Is that all you're going to say?

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:06.750
Aren't you going to greet her properly?

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.450
What do you want? A formal bow?

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.920
Fine by me. Go on, do it.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.390
A simple hello is enough of a greeting.
Being too formal can feel cold.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.530
It's nice when a mother and daughter
are like friends.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.600
Mother and daughter like friends, my foot.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.070
She's really living it up.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.410
Being casual is fine,
but you have to know your place.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.880
I'll handle it.
It doesn't look good when you intervene.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:33.810
You think so?

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.310
Managing the household
is your job now, anyway.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.750
I asked you to get lunch ready.
How's it coming?

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.850
She wasn't able to eat any breakfast.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.490
It's ready, sir.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.390
- Why don't you rest a bit before we eat?
- Okay.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.800
It must feel like
you're in a stranger's house, right?

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:01.810
You need to start making it feel
like home.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.680
I don't mind if the house feels strange,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.880
but family as strangers is worse.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.950
What? Why would they feel like strangers?

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.580
You already know everyone.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.090
I was a subordinate to the president
and the vice director.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.190
That was just your rank at the company.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.420
In this house, you outrank them.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.190
That's easy for you to say.
Do you really think it works that way?

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.760
Then what was the point
of us getting married?

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.130
Do whatever you see fit.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.170
What's there to worry about
when I've got your back?

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.820
If I can just figure out
who owns this handkerchief,

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.260
then I can find out who murdered Mr. Jo.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.270
- I'm heading out.
- Have a good day.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.280
Let's have a word.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.360
The food has way too much MSG in it.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.690
And the side dishes are store-bought.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.630
Nobody's ever gotten sick from eating it.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.070
It's not something that
makes you sick right away.

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.630
But it builds up in your body
and will cause problems eventually.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.970
Even if it's a hassle,

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:41.640
you should make side dishes yourself.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.580
I have to step out for a bit.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.140
Why not clean the house while I'm gone?

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.050
If the two of you split the work,

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.950
no, on second thought,

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.880
there's one more person who does nothing.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.990
Who does nothing?

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:57.720
Are you talking about my husband?

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.320
But we have a housekeeper coming.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.030
I know.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.560
But managing help is very different
when you know how to do the work yourself,

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.030
and when you don't.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.870
I can tell just by looking around.
Only the most obvious spots are clean,

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.340
but all the stains are still there.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.340
You don't know what your cleaner misses
or where she cuts corners, do you?

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.120
I bet you've never once supervised
the helpers while they work.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.920
The mildew in the bathroom says it all.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.160
Well, I suppose...

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.490
That's why you should do it.
Think of it as learning the ropes.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.760
You have to know the work
to manage them properly.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.570
I'll be back in two hours.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.440
Get to it, you two.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.320
Honey. Darling. Come on, wake up.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.150
Gosh, what is it?

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.220
You know I didn't sleep
a wink last night...

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.090
because of all the stress with my father.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.500
You're not going to believe this.
That woman told me to do the housework.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.170
I mean, why should I have to do something
I've never done in my life?

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.470
Who did? That woman?

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.970
She said I must know the work to manage.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.140
She's going out,

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.010
and she expects it done on her return.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.040
And you're supposed to help, too.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:29.810
- She said you fool around all day.
- What? She really said that?

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.920
- Gosh, has that woman lost her mind?
- What do I do? Honey, should I do it?

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.160
Forget it. Who does she think she is?
Don't do it.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.360
If she says anything,
just tell her I told you not to.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.890
- Then I'm not doing it, okay?
- Don't do it.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.630
So, how did the first night go?
You did as I instructed, right?

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.830
I did it too last night.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.770
Make Min Doo Sik drink this.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.740
It'll make sure he stays dull at night.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.050
Anyway, now that you've signed away
your rights to the shares,

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.080
we need to find a way
to nullify that agreement.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.990
I signed them because of the marriage,

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.450
but he probably had them notarized.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.760
That means they're legally binding.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.360
The only way is
for him to destroy the papers himself.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.460
Exactly.
He has to have a change of heart...

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.470
and hand over
the Minkang Distribution shares to you.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.040
For that to happen, there needs to be
some kind of catalyst for Chairman Min.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.120
Are you taking a break
after finishing the chores I gave you?

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.150
No.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.190
No?

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.390
What should I do, Manager Gong?

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.830
She's asking if we've finished
the chores she gave us.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.000
Well, you see...

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.970
It's just that neither Ms. Ja Kyung
nor I have ever cleaned before.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.700
I'm quite sure I made myself
perfectly clear earlier.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.670
My husband said
that you're just Father's woman,

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.510
not our mother,
and that you should know your place.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:24.730
What the...

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.500
Are you out of your mind?

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.170
Who do you think you're talking to?
How dare you address me like that?

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.100
I am, legally and officially,
the lady of this house.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.140
Then go and be his woman to my father.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.550
Why are you messing with me
when we're not even related?

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.750
You expect me to call you Mother?

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.150
You were my subordinate until recently.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.590
Anyone can see
how messed up this situation is.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:54.390
Watch your mouth.
Unless you want water thrown in your face.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.990
This woman is unbelievable...

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.400
- Let go of me!
- Ji Seop, no!

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.400
- I said let go!
- Ji Seop, stop!

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.200
- I swear, you won't get away with this!
- Ji Seop.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.270
Let go!

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.510
No, stop!

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.580
Why is it just you two?

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.020
Where's your mother-in-law?

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.880
I'm not sure.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.800
I'm home.
Why didn't you come out to greet me?

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.670
Have you been crying?

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.740
A new bride should be all smiles,
so why the waterworks?

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.510
Your son called me your woman...

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.510
and told me not to act
like the lady of the house.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.780
I wasn't expecting to be treated
with the utmost respect,

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.990
but to hear him say it to my face,
it was just so hurtful.

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.350
What?

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.320
That little punk.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.560
Hey! Min Ji Seop!

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.860
Get out here right now, you little punk!

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.110
- What did you say to your new mom today?
- Come on, Dad.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.980
It's your choice to marry her
because you like her,

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.610
but expecting your children to treat her
like our mother is asking too much.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.750
What did you just say?

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.850
She's younger than me. I can't do it.

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.550
Could you do it if you were me?

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:30.490
It's not natural. It's not right.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.090
In a word, this family is a complete mess!

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.320
- Why, you little!
- Chairman Min!

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.260
Listen up, everyone.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.070
Any disrespect to this woman
is disrespect to me!

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.770
Anyone who goes against her wishes
or thinks they're her equal...

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.010
will be thrown out of this house. Got it?

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.110
You need to be tougher on them.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.180
They're treating you like a pushover
because you're always so polite.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.650
That's enough. Please go back inside.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.900
I'm so upset.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:13.660
Don't be upset.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.000
I'll make sure Ji Seop never acts
so disrespectfully to you again.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.770
It's not because of Ji Seop.
It's because of me.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.210
I feel like I've caused nothing
but trouble by marrying you.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.940
Don't say that.
Why would you think such a thing?

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.850
All I ever wanted was to be by your side.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.420
I know that. Of course I do.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.020
- That reminds me. Time for your tonic.
- What tonic?

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.860
Your herbal tonic.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.190
They say it'll boost your energy
and clear your head.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.730
I had a top doctor prepare this for you,
so you have to take it every day.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.840
- When did you do all this?
- If I don't look after you, who will?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.400
I'll bring it out.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.370
- And when you're finished, I'll get more.
- Thanks to you, I'll live a long life.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.310
You'd better live a long life.
Or are you planning to leave me behind?

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.380
- As if I'd let you go first!
- Oh please.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.030
So, is everything taken care of?

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.930
Yes, sir. It'll be closed soon...

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.670
and classified as
an accidental death of a vagrant.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.170
- Good. That's a relief.
- Oh, but Chairman Min,

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.780
there's something Jo Pil Doo said.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.450
That Han Kyung Soo's son is undercover...

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.750
and has infiltrated your ranks.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.820
Should I try and find out who he is?

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.690
That's not your concern.
I'll handle it myself.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.820
- So you just back off.
- Yes, sir. I understand.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.500
Who the heck could Han Kyung Soo's son be?

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.200
Then again,

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.400
what could he possibly do
to get revenge for his father?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.970
There are no witnesses or evidence.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.810
What about that woman, Lucia? How is she?

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.980
It feels like some kind of curse.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.150
I tried to kick her out of the company,
and instead, she's now in our home.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.520
At least there's no chance
of her getting company shares, right?

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.090
I'm worried about that, too.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.530
She must have signed a waiver
to marry my father.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.360
If she's determined to reclaim the shares,
a simple waiver won't stop her.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.760
You don't have to worry about that.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.140
The waiver was notarized.
So unless Chairman Min nullifies it,

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.470
it remains legally binding.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.170
My father would never nullify it, right?

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.840
Not unless cats start barking.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.180
Not only did she try to make me do chores,

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.650
she threw a bucket of water on Ji Seop!

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:48.450
Really?

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.420
What in the world is wrong with her?

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.360
A newlywed bride, how dare she
treat her revered in-laws that way?

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.460
It's all because of that crazy old fool.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.660
Our in-law is absolutely mad about women.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.170
In a powerful family like that,
the wrong person can spell ruin.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.400
What does your husband say?

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:08.970
He says she looks down on him
because he's unemployed.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.180
Dad, what's the deal
with getting his job back?

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.480
Was your promise just a bunch
of empty words?

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.710
Your father was already planning to visit
your father-in-law.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:21.720
That's right. I'm a meticulous planner.
I have a plan, so don't you worry.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.190
He's like putty in my hands.
Putty. Soft, pliable putty.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.260
Putty?

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.690
- Clay, maybe?
- He's always been my putty.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.070
Yes, Manager Gong.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:38.040
If you're about done there, hurry back.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.900
Why? Did something happen?

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:45.710
The housekeeper isn't coming today.
I called and told her not to.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.250
What? Why?

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.820
I'll explain later.
Just make sure the house is spotless.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.020
It's not that I don't want to.
I'm telling you, I don't know how.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:01.560
I mean, I've never done it before.
How am I supposed to do it?

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.290
Was anyone born knowing how to do this?

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.630
You can just learn as you go,
one thing at a time.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:11.070
Oh, and get Ji Seop out here, too.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.950
She says you have to come out and clean?

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.550
- Who says?
- Who do you think?

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.160
Now what?

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:40.400
It's a big house for two women to handle.
I figured the son should help out.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.770
Ja Kyung, I left garlic on the table.
I want it all peeled.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.340
If we leave it in the pantry,
it'll all go bad.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.640
I doubt you have work clothes,
so put these on.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.850
What? You expect me to wear this?

00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.650
It doesn't get any better than this
for work clothes.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.490
I'm on my way to see Chairman Min,
so if you don't want to work, say so now.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.390
Oh, right. And the floors only get clean
if you scrub them by hand.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.140
Oh, when did you get here?

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.440
Just now.
I thought these might wilt, so I came.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.840
Why go to all this trouble?
You could've just had my secretary do it.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.580
I just wanted an excuse
to see you again, Chairman.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.080
So, does this vase officially become
my responsibility now?

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:32.520
Meaning no one else can touch it?

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.870
Gosh, what is this, seriously?

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.170
It's ruining my nails. Seriously.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.470
Just do it for now.
Or do you want to face the Chairman?

00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.580
It stings so much.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.210
Seriously, this is like being tear-gassed.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.420
Your eye makeup is running.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.990
What? Where?

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:10.890
On both of your eyes.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:11.920
On my left eye?

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.490
It stings!

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:19.130
It stings so bad!

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.970
Gosh, what's with her now?

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:24.770
Goodness.

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.470
Who even scrubs floors by hand
in the 21st century?

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.470
This is a special kind of torture.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.350
Darn it...

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.120
Well, well, look who it is.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.390
Ma'am, what brings you here?

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.560
You should be more careful at home.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.340
I'm just worried about you.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.200
One person knowing your secret is enough,
wouldn't you say?

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:19.190
(Director Moon Tae Kyung)

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:37.470
What?

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:38.840
The case is closed?

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.350
What do you mean? How can it be over
after just a few days?

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.150
You can't stop the investigation midway!
This makes no sense, does it?

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.560
How can they clear him of criminal charges
without a proper investigation?

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.260
I'm not trying to pick a fight.
I'm just so frustrated.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.360
I don't get why they're trying to bury
this case so quickly!

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.600
Hello?

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:09.240
I heard your phone call.
Did something happen?

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:13.810
Mr. Jo...

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.380
has passed away.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.080
What?

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:22.990
He was murdered.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.750
I think.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.070
If he was murdered,
not an accidental death,

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.370
and right before applying for a retrial...

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.640
Something is strange.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.380
You said if we could prove his alibi,
we could turn everything around.

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:48.750
At the crime scene...

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.660
I found this.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.960
I'm pretty sure it belongs to the killer.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.190
I was going to give it to the detective...

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.530
but something felt off,
so I decided to hold on to it.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:09.600
If I can just figure out
who this belongs to,

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.670
I think I might be able to solve this.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.960
Oh my.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.290
This...

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.330
It's Chairman Min Du Sik's.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.640
(The Woman Who Swallowed the Sun)

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.930
