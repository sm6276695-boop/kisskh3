00:00:01.086 --> 00:00:02.826
(Episode 85)

00:00:02.826 --> 00:00:07.766
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:09.426
What's going on?

00:00:11.996 --> 00:00:12.996
What?

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:15.136
Hong Man Su was caught kidnapping Kang Jae In.

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.806
The police are heading to the scene to take him in.

00:00:18.836 --> 00:00:21.506
Were you the one who ordered this?

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:22.676
It wasn't me!

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:25.976
Didn't I say to catch that lunatic, Hong Man Su?

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:29.446
Is Jae In okay?

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:34.526
Where is the scene?

00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:37.526
Got it.

00:00:40.696 --> 00:00:41.726
That jerk...

00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:44.636
I told him not to make a move without my permission.

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:51.206
I think I finally understand now...

00:00:53.606 --> 00:00:55.246
why it bothers me so much...

00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:57.676
when you're hurting or struggling.

00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:00.216
Now I know why.

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:10.496
Jae In.

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.396
I love you.

00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:24.006
- Do Yun... - Please, let me finish.

00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:27.506
I'm not asking you to accept my love right now.

00:01:28.446 --> 00:01:30.746
I'm not suggesting we start anything right away, either.

00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:32.846
For now...

00:01:33.916 --> 00:01:36.246
When you're in danger like just now...

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:38.816
and when you struggle or feel lost,

00:01:40.926 --> 00:01:43.056
I hope that I can be...

00:01:44.756 --> 00:01:46.226
the first person you think of.

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:50.026
That's enough for me.

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.566
I'm not asking for anything more.

00:01:57.876 --> 00:01:58.976
Thank you.

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:01.346
And...

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:03.546
I'm sorry.

00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:06.876
Right now, all I think about...

00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:10.246
is getting revenge for Eun Ho and my father.

00:02:11.586 --> 00:02:12.956
My own happiness or love...

00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:19.496
They feel like selfish luxuries I can't afford.

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:22.326
I understand.

00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:24.596
I hesitate to say this...

00:02:25.096 --> 00:02:26.596
for Do Hee.

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:27.736
But...

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:33.876
I still wanted to tell you how I feel.

00:02:46.056 --> 00:02:48.386
All I can say for now is this.

00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:51.596
When this is all over,

00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:53.826
after we clear Do Hee's name,

00:02:54.996 --> 00:02:58.566
and get justice for Eun Ho and my father,

00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:01.906
let's talk again then.

00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:08.306
Just hearing you say that is enough for now.

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:29.466
What do you think you're doing here?

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:35.466
I heard you were kidnapped. Are you all right?

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:45.746
Go ahead.

00:03:48.116 --> 00:03:49.516
Don't worry about me. Just go.

00:03:56.726 --> 00:03:57.896
Jae In, wait.

00:03:58.656 --> 00:03:59.726
That's enough.

00:04:02.796 --> 00:04:05.296
What do you think you're doing, keeping someone who was kidnapped?

00:04:06.136 --> 00:04:07.966
You want to know? Fine, I'll tell you.

00:04:08.836 --> 00:04:11.336
I just confessed my feelings to Jae In.

00:04:14.846 --> 00:04:17.316
You'd better know your place.

00:04:18.146 --> 00:04:19.546
Who do you think you are?

00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:21.916
The way you're acting right now,

00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:25.286
is a classic inferiority complex.

00:04:25.956 --> 00:04:29.626
- What did you say? - At least I can be honest with her.

00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:32.496
You, on the other hand, don't even have that right.

00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:39.896
You had someone so precious right by your side,

00:04:40.766 --> 00:04:43.406
but you're the one who blew every chance you had.

00:04:43.936 --> 00:04:46.536
So don't you dare come around now acting like you're somebody.

00:04:47.806 --> 00:04:49.176
It's pathetic.

00:04:56.046 --> 00:05:00.316
Kang Jae In forced me to confess, and she recorded it for the police.

00:05:00.656 --> 00:05:03.686
I told them I was calling my lawyer, but I called you.

00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:06.556
- You have to get me out of here. - What exactly did you say?

00:05:06.656 --> 00:05:07.726
That I kidnapped Hwang Eun Ho,

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:10.026
that you told me to kill Jae In,

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:11.136
that Eun Ho died,

00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:12.866
and that you told me to kidnap Kang Jae In's mother.

00:05:12.936 --> 00:05:15.806
Are you insane? After all the money I gave you,

00:05:15.866 --> 00:05:17.736
how could you spill everything like that?

00:05:19.576 --> 00:05:23.676
Look, a recording made under duress isn't admissible in court,

00:05:23.776 --> 00:05:26.016
and other than your word, they have no other evidence.

00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:28.616
So just keep your mouth shut.

00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:32.286
I'm the only one who can get you out of this.

00:05:41.026 --> 00:05:42.826
"Hey, Sook Ja, get a grip!"

00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:45.166
I should report this jerk too.

00:05:45.436 --> 00:05:47.096
How dare they call me just "Sook Ja" without respect?

00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:48.836
"Hey, Sook Ja?"

00:05:50.466 --> 00:05:53.136
Mom, is there even a point to this?

00:05:53.906 --> 00:05:57.176
I mean, I'm taking screenshots of every single one to report them,

00:05:57.246 --> 00:05:59.676
but it's harder to find one that isn't a malicious comment.

00:05:59.816 --> 00:06:01.416
"Noh Sook Ja", with five exclamation marks!

00:06:01.546 --> 00:06:03.086
"Die, you crazy mother-in-law!"

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:06.256
"Chairman Hwang Gi Chan of YL Group, I hope you die too, you cheater!"

00:06:06.286 --> 00:06:08.656
Are you serious? Stop reading those!

00:06:08.886 --> 00:06:10.426
Mom, your name's all over this.

00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:13.256
"Look at his mother, No wonder he turned out like that "

00:06:13.396 --> 00:06:15.996
"Looking for party members to commit Noh Sook Ja."

00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:19.536
Darn it! The troll isn't a stranger online, and he's right here.

00:06:19.536 --> 00:06:21.766
Shut your mouth!

00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:27.976
Oh, Gi Chan, perfect timing. Come take a look at this.

00:06:28.446 --> 00:06:32.846
Everyone who watched that Expose World video is blaming us.

00:06:32.946 --> 00:06:34.216
It feels like they just don't stop it!

00:06:34.216 --> 00:06:35.716
Now they're at it again.

00:06:36.246 --> 00:06:41.226
So, is it okay to just report them and leave it at that?

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:45.726
I'm talking about reopening Kim Do Hee's case.

00:06:45.996 --> 00:06:48.696
They've been bothering me a lot because of it.

00:06:48.796 --> 00:06:50.326
What are people saying?

00:06:50.396 --> 00:06:51.836
They say Jae In's mom killed Kim Do Hee...

00:06:51.836 --> 00:06:54.806
mistaking her for your mistress.

00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:59.576
But since you had an affair, and now Se Ri is your mistress,

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:01.546
they say you and Se Ri should share the blame,

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.606
no matter who the killer is.

00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:05.546
Something like that.

00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:09.086
Now that I say it out loud, they kind of have a point.

00:07:10.686 --> 00:07:13.416
Excuse me, Na Ra, who are you calling a mistress?

00:07:13.856 --> 00:07:16.986
Why are you dwelling on the past? The present is what matters.

00:07:17.256 --> 00:07:20.126
I'm Gi Chan's lawful wife now.

00:07:20.326 --> 00:07:23.426
Besides, who told her to jump to conclusions and kill someone?

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.696
That's Ja Young's fault.

00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:28.966
- Isn't that right, Mother? - Of course it is.

00:07:29.606 --> 00:07:31.636
Ja Young is the one who needs to take responsibility.

00:07:31.776 --> 00:07:33.106
The killer must be Choi Ja Young...

00:07:33.106 --> 00:07:34.946
even if the police start the reinvestigation.

00:07:34.946 --> 00:07:36.076
She just has to be.

00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:41.416
Follow me.

00:07:52.796 --> 00:07:55.196
I told you not to act so recklessly.

00:07:55.426 --> 00:07:58.096
Who are you to order someone to kill Jae In?

00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:00.836
Fine. Then you might as well just kill me.

00:08:01.436 --> 00:08:04.976
Because that's the only way you'll ever get rid of me.

00:08:13.346 --> 00:08:15.246
This is all your fault.

00:08:17.046 --> 00:08:20.586
Do you think I want to kill her because I'm hung up on the past?

00:08:20.856 --> 00:08:21.956
No.

00:08:22.486 --> 00:08:27.096
The more you want her instead of me, the more you seek her out,

00:08:27.566 --> 00:08:30.026
the more I turn into this.

00:08:30.326 --> 00:08:33.136
You're the one who drove me to this.

00:08:34.136 --> 00:08:35.836
It's all up to you.

00:08:36.166 --> 00:08:38.506
I'm the only woman for you.

00:08:38.806 --> 00:08:43.146
I'm your only wife and the only mother of your child.

00:08:46.846 --> 00:08:49.386
Your secrets are our secrets,

00:08:49.686 --> 00:08:52.356
and your shame is our shame.

00:08:52.686 --> 00:08:56.126
So from now on, you focus only on me.

00:08:56.356 --> 00:09:00.296
Or else, even I don't know what I'll do next.

00:09:15.076 --> 00:09:19.016
I was being blackmailed at the time. I just said whatever came to mind.

00:09:19.516 --> 00:09:21.446
This is so unfair.

00:09:23.516 --> 00:09:26.486
If you're not going to believe me, I'm exercising my right to silence.

00:09:27.926 --> 00:09:30.126
You're questioning me with a voice recording...

00:09:30.126 --> 00:09:32.156
that was coerced to be testimony?

00:09:32.796 --> 00:09:35.196
Did you order a hit on Kang Jae In?

00:09:35.426 --> 00:09:37.296
How many times do I have to tell you it wasn't me?

00:09:38.366 --> 00:09:41.866
Do you have any proof it was me? Any concrete evidence?

00:09:42.566 --> 00:09:43.566
Of course, you don't.

00:09:44.036 --> 00:09:46.976
If you had any evidence, you wouldn't be testing me like this.

00:09:50.406 --> 00:09:52.816
Call me back when you have some actual evidence.

00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:55.586
And stop dragging an innocent person down here.

00:09:56.946 --> 00:09:59.986
I'll stay and handle the rest. You may leave first.

00:10:11.766 --> 00:10:13.236
(YL Planning and Design Team)

00:10:13.366 --> 00:10:14.466
So, right now...

00:10:14.806 --> 00:10:17.606
are you telling me Kang Se Ri is being questioned by the police?

00:10:18.376 --> 00:10:19.376
Yes.

00:10:19.436 --> 00:10:23.276
Kang Se Ri is a psycho, isn't she? Murder, kidnapping...

00:10:23.746 --> 00:10:26.676
Jae In, from now on, let's commute together.

00:10:27.616 --> 00:10:28.986
I'll keep you safe.

00:10:29.946 --> 00:10:31.516
You should, Jae In.

00:10:32.356 --> 00:10:34.186
You never know what she'll do next.

00:10:34.686 --> 00:10:37.726
Kang Se Ri will have to lay low for a while.

00:10:38.356 --> 00:10:40.696
Hong Man Su, who she used to order around like a servant, kidnapped me.

00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:44.166
As the victim, I was an eyewitness and already gave my testimony.

00:10:45.136 --> 00:10:46.466
So even if we can't prove her other crimes,

00:10:46.766 --> 00:10:49.966
they said she won't be able to avoid being arrested for this incident.

00:10:55.546 --> 00:10:57.006
My apologies for being late.

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.916
You have the nerve to show up for work?

00:11:00.276 --> 00:11:04.186
You ordered Jae In's kidnapping, and you dare to show your face here?

00:11:05.916 --> 00:11:08.486
In a way, I'm almost impressed.

00:11:08.556 --> 00:11:12.596
I don't know what you've heard, but I haven't done anything wrong.

00:11:12.796 --> 00:11:15.726
Hong Man Su framed me.

00:11:16.066 --> 00:11:19.266
I was so wrongfully accused that I explained myself to the police.

00:11:22.706 --> 00:11:24.506
I'll go copy today's materials. There are too many.

00:11:29.846 --> 00:11:33.646
The voice recording alone isn't enough to get Kang Se Ri anyway.

00:11:35.046 --> 00:11:38.116
We'll have to settle for keeping Hong Man Su in check for now.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:39.686
Don't get too worked up.

00:11:42.586 --> 00:11:43.786
I'm too worked up.

00:11:44.796 --> 00:11:46.226
I'm going to go grab an iced coffee.

00:11:50.096 --> 00:11:51.166
Jae In.

00:11:51.736 --> 00:11:53.236
Anyway, you need to be careful.

00:11:53.936 --> 00:11:56.606
Even a cornered rat will bite.

00:11:57.336 --> 00:11:58.376
Yes.

00:12:04.246 --> 00:12:05.376
Ta-da!

00:12:06.246 --> 00:12:07.446
It's a gift for you.

00:12:08.086 --> 00:12:09.146
What's this for?

00:12:09.586 --> 00:12:12.356
You've dealt with the police and struggled with Jae In.

00:12:12.516 --> 00:12:13.856
You've had a rough time recently.

00:12:14.286 --> 00:12:17.226
It's a lucky charm. It'll protect you, Seung Woo.

00:12:18.656 --> 00:12:19.826
Aren't you going to take it?

00:12:20.956 --> 00:12:21.966
That's okay.

00:12:22.166 --> 00:12:24.766
But I went out of my way to buy this because I was worried about you!

00:12:27.966 --> 00:12:31.836
It only works if you keep it on you, so make sure you do.

00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:36.146
And don't you ever, ever open it.

00:12:36.406 --> 00:12:37.706
It'll lose its power.

00:12:38.516 --> 00:12:40.116
You got this!

00:12:42.586 --> 00:12:44.956
Hey, take it back. I told you that I'm fine.

00:13:03.506 --> 00:13:05.636
What is this? It looks like a Chinese character.

00:13:14.616 --> 00:13:15.616
"Love"?

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:17.316
The character for love?

00:13:18.856 --> 00:13:20.356
Oh, no. It's so creepy!

00:13:21.886 --> 00:13:23.056
I almost fell for it.

00:14:04.766 --> 00:14:06.736
Where are you going all of a sudden?

00:14:06.936 --> 00:14:08.636
Director Do, what's come over you?

00:14:09.306 --> 00:14:11.536
How many times do I have to tell you I'm going to the gallery?

00:14:12.036 --> 00:14:14.806
Ma'am, the gallery is closed today.

00:14:15.006 --> 00:14:16.146
Director Do.

00:14:16.806 --> 00:14:19.616
The gallery opening is closed for the visitors.

00:14:19.916 --> 00:14:21.746
I have even more work to do on closing day.

00:14:22.316 --> 00:14:23.386
I'm leaving.

00:14:23.716 --> 00:14:24.886
Director Choi.

00:14:27.686 --> 00:14:30.086
Okay, Director Do, I hate to ask,

00:14:30.886 --> 00:14:32.726
but could you just drop my mom off at the gallery?

00:14:32.826 --> 00:14:35.196
I'll stop by on my way out and try to convince her.

00:14:36.696 --> 00:14:38.696
Okay, thank you.

00:14:46.206 --> 00:14:51.076
Darn it. This whole museum is empty...

00:14:52.576 --> 00:14:53.946
Oh, wait. There's a guy.

00:14:54.646 --> 00:14:56.046
Is he here to buy a painting?

00:15:01.356 --> 00:15:02.386
Hello there.

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:07.356
Oh, hello.

00:15:08.796 --> 00:15:11.296
You seem to like this painting.

00:15:11.396 --> 00:15:13.696
You've been looking at it for a while.

00:15:14.566 --> 00:15:16.636
You clearly have a good eye for art.

00:15:17.466 --> 00:15:20.606
That's the most expensive piece we have.

00:15:23.606 --> 00:15:25.946
You seem to work here at JY Gallery.

00:15:26.446 --> 00:15:28.516
Can I meet Director Choi Ja Young?

00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:34.586
I'm Lee Tae Ho.

00:15:36.586 --> 00:15:39.296
The director of this gallery isn't Choi Ja Young.

00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:40.696
Now It's me.

00:15:40.726 --> 00:15:44.296
I'm Director Noh Sook Ja of JY Gallery.

00:15:45.336 --> 00:15:48.366
Now, is there a painting you'd like to buy?

00:15:49.066 --> 00:15:52.076
Isn't Director Choi Ja Young the director here?

00:15:56.646 --> 00:15:58.246
Aren't you here to buy a painting?

00:15:59.776 --> 00:16:02.446
Do you have Director Choi Ja Young's contact information?

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:06.686
Why does he keep bringing up that jinxed name?

00:16:08.226 --> 00:16:12.326
If you're curious about her, check the news. Don't ask me.

00:16:21.236 --> 00:16:22.336
Darn it.

00:16:22.836 --> 00:16:24.206
I was so close to making a sale,

00:16:24.266 --> 00:16:27.306
but now my cheeks hurt for nothing.

00:16:30.476 --> 00:16:31.616
Mom, where are you?

00:16:32.316 --> 00:16:34.846
What do you see around you? Any buildings or stores?

00:16:36.186 --> 00:16:39.056
Mom, stay right there. I'm right up ahead.

00:16:55.736 --> 00:16:56.866
Hello, Mr. Lee.

00:16:57.206 --> 00:16:59.376
I'm Lee Chan Seong, your assistant in Korea.

00:16:59.576 --> 00:17:01.646
Oh, hello.

00:17:01.906 --> 00:17:05.346
I planned to get you at the airport, so I'm surprised you're here first.

00:17:05.516 --> 00:17:07.316
I take it there's a painting you're looking for at this gallery.

00:17:07.516 --> 00:17:10.546
No. There's someone I was determined to find in Korea.

00:17:11.856 --> 00:17:16.126
It seems word's out you're here. My phone's been ringing nonstop.

00:17:16.286 --> 00:17:18.096
It's not an official visit, though.

00:17:18.256 --> 00:17:19.956
This time, I came here for vacation...

00:17:20.056 --> 00:17:21.726
and to propose a collaboration with Designer L,

00:17:21.726 --> 00:17:23.126
who’s currently in Korea.

00:17:23.396 --> 00:17:24.736
And while I'm at it, I thought I'd scout...

00:17:24.736 --> 00:17:25.766
for some new Korean artists.

00:17:26.666 --> 00:17:28.706
Let's take our time with the business side of things.

00:17:28.766 --> 00:17:31.736
Yes, of course. The car is over this way.

00:17:31.876 --> 00:17:34.476
- What about your other bags? - They're already at the hotel.

00:17:35.446 --> 00:17:40.116
I heard Director Choi Ja Young quit. Please look into that for us.

00:17:40.246 --> 00:17:41.346
And her daughter, Kang Jae In too.

00:17:44.416 --> 00:17:45.816
Tae Ho is in the country?

00:17:45.886 --> 00:17:47.486
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:17:48.256 --> 00:17:50.626
Find out where he's staying and what his schedule is,

00:17:51.626 --> 00:17:52.756
and set up a meeting.

00:17:53.456 --> 00:17:55.426
I'll be the one reaching out, so make it fast.

00:18:10.906 --> 00:18:11.916
Yun Hee.

00:18:12.476 --> 00:18:15.216
We're having a guest over for dinner tonight.

00:18:17.716 --> 00:18:19.916
That's unusual for you. You never brought a guest home.

00:18:20.656 --> 00:18:21.956
Is it someone important?

00:18:22.286 --> 00:18:24.656
Yes, a very important guest.

00:18:25.856 --> 00:18:27.696
Then I'd better go grocery shopping.

00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:30.966
Do you know what their favourite food is?

00:18:31.196 --> 00:18:35.506
Oh, it's fine. We'll just eat what we normally do.

00:18:35.606 --> 00:18:36.936
So you really don't need to worry about it.

00:18:37.336 --> 00:18:39.136
But they're our guest. How can I not?

00:18:43.006 --> 00:18:45.016
I'll take care of it, so just hurry up and get to work.

00:18:51.286 --> 00:18:52.316
Hey, Mrs. Park?

00:18:53.556 --> 00:18:54.586
What?

00:18:55.856 --> 00:18:57.526
Who's killing anyone?

00:18:58.026 --> 00:18:59.826
I'm busy, so stop spouting nonsense and hang up!

00:19:03.766 --> 00:19:07.436
Darn it. It’s already frustrating that I can’t upload the video,

00:19:07.566 --> 00:19:09.066
but everyone calls me,

00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:11.806
asking if an innocent person died because of our Gi Chan's affair.

00:19:12.406 --> 00:19:14.976
They say, "The news said Choi Ja Young is innocent!"

00:19:16.006 --> 00:19:18.716
They're just revelling in our misfortune.

00:19:20.446 --> 00:19:24.016
Why is Gi Chan getting all the blame that Choi Ja Young deserves?

00:19:24.316 --> 00:19:25.856
Is there any proof that Gi Chan did it?

00:19:27.456 --> 00:19:28.686
"Manipulating public opinion?"

00:19:28.826 --> 00:19:30.756
Do they think I can't do that?

00:19:33.496 --> 00:19:36.796
- No. - Kang Jae In bribed the media...

00:19:36.866 --> 00:19:39.936
and is spreading false propaganda.

00:19:40.896 --> 00:19:43.306
The one who killed Assistant Manager Kim Do Hee...

00:19:43.306 --> 00:19:45.076
is Choi Ja Young!

00:19:46.076 --> 00:19:48.206
To all the employees of YL Group!

00:19:48.906 --> 00:19:51.146
Don't be fooled!

00:19:51.976 --> 00:19:53.576
Because of Kang Jae In's slander,

00:19:53.646 --> 00:19:57.046
my family is now in shambles.

00:19:57.746 --> 00:20:00.556
My eldest son was so stressed out by this whole thing...

00:20:00.616 --> 00:20:02.756
that he's lost his mind.

00:20:06.296 --> 00:20:09.226
And I can barely swallow my food each day,

00:20:09.466 --> 00:20:11.896
so I'm nothing but skin and bones now.

00:20:12.366 --> 00:20:14.636
(Kang Jae In, Stop Media Manipulation and Lies)

00:20:14.936 --> 00:20:16.636
Look at me.

00:20:18.336 --> 00:20:19.806
Look at me.

00:20:20.706 --> 00:20:22.346
Look at me.

00:20:22.676 --> 00:20:25.546
- Mom, what are you doing? - What if Gi Chan finds out?

00:20:25.816 --> 00:20:28.946
He'll praise me when he finds out. Tell him his mom came here to fight.

00:20:30.916 --> 00:20:32.216
Let me see that.

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:36.386
Stop the media manipulation and the lies!

00:20:37.186 --> 00:20:41.726
- Stop the lies and manipulation! - Stop it!

00:20:42.466 --> 00:20:44.936
- Stop it! - Stop it!

00:20:44.936 --> 00:20:45.936
Mom...

00:20:48.136 --> 00:20:49.206
What? My mother's there?

00:20:56.176 --> 00:20:57.476
Well, Chairman Hwang, aren't you something?

00:20:58.006 --> 00:21:01.816
As if your wife wasn't enough, now your mother supports you too.

00:21:03.046 --> 00:21:05.286
Now, even the employees who didn't know will find out.

00:21:06.256 --> 00:21:08.656
That the Kim Do Hee case is being reinvestigated,

00:21:09.356 --> 00:21:11.796
and that Jae In's mom might be innocent after all.

00:21:12.656 --> 00:21:15.566
Since your mother is going to shout it from the rooftops,

00:21:15.896 --> 00:21:17.696
should I be thanking you?

00:21:18.126 --> 00:21:20.036
If Director Choi Ja Young is innocent, then I guess so.

00:21:20.866 --> 00:21:23.806
Then there's always Assistant Manager Kang Seung Woo.

00:21:24.166 --> 00:21:27.076
If you don't want his name to be dragged through the mud,

00:21:27.506 --> 00:21:28.546
I suggest you leave.

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.746
It won't do you any good to provoke me.

00:21:31.476 --> 00:21:33.776
(Chairman Hwang Gi Chan)

00:21:42.726 --> 00:21:45.296
Keep my Seung Woo's name out of your filthy mouth.

00:21:47.096 --> 00:21:48.396
Why don't you try stopping your own mother?

00:21:49.366 --> 00:21:50.696
I'm embarrassed for you.

00:22:07.276 --> 00:22:10.916
Stop the media manipulation and the lies!

00:22:12.386 --> 00:22:13.386
Hey...

00:22:13.456 --> 00:22:15.656
(Innocent If Rich, Guilty If Poor)

00:22:19.496 --> 00:22:20.556
Come with me now!

00:22:33.706 --> 00:22:35.876
Oh, I have to go to the bathroom. The bathroom.

00:22:38.876 --> 00:22:40.216
What were you thinking?

00:22:41.076 --> 00:22:43.846
How could you take my brother to work and do something like that?

00:22:45.016 --> 00:22:46.016
No, but...

00:22:46.386 --> 00:22:49.056
I was doing it for you.

00:22:49.526 --> 00:22:51.086
I told you I would handle it.

00:22:51.626 --> 00:22:53.096
When I tell you to stay out of it, you stay out of it!

00:22:53.656 --> 00:22:57.266
Why would you humiliate me publicly?

00:23:00.366 --> 00:23:02.506
Have you no shame?

00:23:03.536 --> 00:23:05.576
You might as well just tell me to die!

00:23:06.676 --> 00:23:07.906
I'm so sorry.

00:23:08.446 --> 00:23:12.016
I was just trying to help you.

00:23:12.846 --> 00:23:14.816
Because you're all I have.

00:23:16.116 --> 00:23:19.116
You're right. I was wrong.

00:24:07.196 --> 00:24:08.196
Bo Ram.

00:24:09.106 --> 00:24:11.836
Ask your uncle to buy you a treat. All right?

00:24:12.036 --> 00:24:15.076
Okay. Uncle, can I have pizza?

00:24:15.446 --> 00:24:16.846
Sure. Pizza it is.

00:24:18.306 --> 00:24:21.216
Your uncle must be bringing someone really important home,

00:24:21.346 --> 00:24:23.446
kicking you and Bo Ram out of the house.

00:24:24.416 --> 00:24:25.516
Have you heard anything?

00:24:27.216 --> 00:24:29.526
It seems to be someone very important to him.

00:24:30.486 --> 00:24:32.056
Come on, Bo Ram. Let's go get pizza.

00:24:32.326 --> 00:24:34.696
- Okay, let's go! - Let's go.

00:24:36.296 --> 00:24:37.766
She's so excited.

00:24:52.676 --> 00:24:55.346
I cooked so much because you said an important guest was coming,

00:24:55.716 --> 00:24:56.716
but what is all this about?

00:24:57.586 --> 00:25:00.286
She is important to me.

00:25:03.826 --> 00:25:05.226
We're getting back together.

00:25:07.826 --> 00:25:08.826
Jung Oh Seong!

00:25:10.396 --> 00:25:12.266
Do you have any self-respect?

00:25:12.836 --> 00:25:15.766
So what if it's in the past? Can you just forget about it?

00:25:16.206 --> 00:25:18.976
Why do you think you spent nearly 30 years drifting at sea?

00:25:19.276 --> 00:25:21.376
It was because of this woman, Kang Mi Ran, and her family.

00:25:22.106 --> 00:25:25.146
I know time can soften old memories, but this is ridiculous.

00:25:27.676 --> 00:25:28.746
About what happened back then,

00:25:29.886 --> 00:25:32.656
there are no excuses for what my family and I did.

00:25:35.286 --> 00:25:40.196
My family was cruel, and I was cowardly and selfish.

00:25:41.696 --> 00:25:43.626
Even though my family was completely against it,

00:25:44.296 --> 00:25:48.266
I should have been honest with Oh Seong about everything,

00:25:49.836 --> 00:25:52.606
so that we could have overcome it together.

00:25:53.306 --> 00:25:54.806
I'm not romanticizing the past.

00:25:55.746 --> 00:25:57.546
She just ghosted me,

00:25:58.076 --> 00:26:01.216
and I lost my career and was forced out to sea.

00:26:01.446 --> 00:26:03.246
I could never forget any of that even if I tried.

00:26:04.246 --> 00:26:06.356
And trust me, I resented her for a long time.

00:26:06.886 --> 00:26:08.586
I even gave her a piece of my mind when we met again.

00:26:09.126 --> 00:26:10.386
All I could see was what I'd been through...

00:26:10.686 --> 00:26:12.756
and how it made me feel.

00:26:13.256 --> 00:26:14.396
So why the change?

00:26:16.626 --> 00:26:17.996
I realised that, just as much as me,

00:26:18.696 --> 00:26:21.266
she was in pain and struggling,

00:26:22.836 --> 00:26:25.036
and that she had to face it all on her own.

00:26:25.776 --> 00:26:27.836
Suddenly, the past didn't seem to matter anymore.

00:26:29.406 --> 00:26:32.416
So I looked at how I feel right now.

00:26:35.586 --> 00:26:36.616
And I realised...

00:26:39.086 --> 00:26:40.986
I'm still in love with her.

00:26:42.556 --> 00:26:44.586
You know what they say, "You can read a person by one thing."

00:26:45.426 --> 00:26:48.896
Fine. Let's say what she did to you is in the past.

00:26:49.896 --> 00:26:52.036
But what about what she did to her own niece, Jae In?

00:26:54.636 --> 00:26:57.736
Can't you see she's been merciless, even to her own flesh and blood?

00:26:58.636 --> 00:26:59.906
People don't change that easily.

00:27:00.706 --> 00:27:02.706
So, she was hurting as much as you.

00:27:03.206 --> 00:27:04.306
Fine.

00:27:04.306 --> 00:27:06.276
But are we supposed to understand her...

00:27:06.276 --> 00:27:08.246
when she says she feels hurt and victimized...

00:27:08.246 --> 00:27:12.716
while stabbing her loved ones and making them bleed?

00:27:27.196 --> 00:27:28.196
I'm sorry.

00:27:30.036 --> 00:27:32.236
The mistakes and all the wrongs I've committed,

00:27:34.276 --> 00:27:35.876
they're all my fault,

00:27:37.506 --> 00:27:39.476
it's a reflection of my own shortcomings.

00:27:42.686 --> 00:27:44.886
I'm not trying to pretend none of it happened.

00:27:46.256 --> 00:27:47.316
To Oh Seong...

00:27:49.286 --> 00:27:51.686
and Jae In,

00:27:53.496 --> 00:27:56.126
I'll spend the rest of my life making up for what I've done

00:27:57.566 --> 00:27:59.496
and begging for their forgiveness.

00:28:01.066 --> 00:28:02.106
So, please,

00:28:03.766 --> 00:28:04.836
just one more time,

00:28:06.076 --> 00:28:07.636
give me one last chance.

00:28:11.146 --> 00:28:12.876
I'll make things right.

00:28:18.786 --> 00:28:21.386
She apologised to Jae In, and Jae In forgave her.

00:28:22.016 --> 00:28:23.026
So, Yun Hee.

00:28:23.386 --> 00:28:27.096
Please try to be happy for us and support our relationship.

00:28:30.426 --> 00:28:33.496
Fine. She apologised to them and they forgave her, so it's done.

00:28:33.636 --> 00:28:34.696
But that's where it ends.

00:28:35.296 --> 00:28:38.806
I still don't want you involved with our family any more.

00:28:40.606 --> 00:28:42.646
You brought her here on your own, so you can see her out yourself.

00:29:20.446 --> 00:29:21.446
We need to talk.

00:29:25.816 --> 00:29:28.086
Fine, my dear son. If you have something to say, say it.

00:29:28.456 --> 00:29:31.626
If it will make you feel better, get it all off your chest.

00:29:32.496 --> 00:29:36.326
Today, you'll meet a special guest as the director of the gallery.

00:29:37.396 --> 00:29:42.306
Oh my goodness. So, is this my debut as Director?

00:29:42.866 --> 00:29:43.866
Something like that.

00:29:44.566 --> 00:29:46.606
This is an important day for both of us,

00:29:47.376 --> 00:29:49.546
so be at the meeting place on time.

00:29:50.306 --> 00:29:52.216
I'll text you the time and location.

00:29:52.816 --> 00:29:57.546
Okay. I promise I won't let you down.

00:29:57.616 --> 00:30:01.086
I'll be on my best behaviour, so you can count on me.

00:30:01.616 --> 00:30:02.626
I'll see you later.

00:30:05.826 --> 00:30:08.156
Hold on. This is no time to stand around.

00:30:08.656 --> 00:30:10.666
What should I wear to leave a good impression...

00:30:10.796 --> 00:30:12.796
on our important guest?

00:30:29.716 --> 00:30:33.256
Mother, it uses high-frequency waves all through your body.

00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:39.256
Welcome. How may I help you...

00:30:40.196 --> 00:30:42.156
It's meant to relieve your various aches and pains.

00:30:43.466 --> 00:30:45.426
A sudden gift? What's the occasion?

00:30:47.066 --> 00:30:49.566
Well, I have that important meeting today,

00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:50.936
so I guess I should give it a try.

00:30:57.746 --> 00:30:59.146
And the buttons are very easy to use.

00:31:00.846 --> 00:31:02.016
This is amazing.

00:31:02.616 --> 00:31:05.416
I just put my feet on it, and my whole body feels warm.

00:31:08.486 --> 00:31:09.986
But, Mother.

00:31:10.086 --> 00:31:11.826
About your meeting today.

00:31:12.086 --> 00:31:13.696
Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:31:14.796 --> 00:31:18.626
I heard the person you're meeting only speaks English.

00:31:19.436 --> 00:31:21.096
What? English?

00:31:22.306 --> 00:31:25.636
Darn it. They should learn to speak Korean.

00:31:26.536 --> 00:31:29.506
You know how on edge Gi Chan is,

00:31:29.576 --> 00:31:31.476
if you mess up this meeting,

00:31:32.046 --> 00:31:35.116
I can just picture how he'll tear into you again.

00:31:35.646 --> 00:31:37.186
Still, what can I do?

00:31:37.346 --> 00:31:38.786
He said I should be there.

00:31:40.186 --> 00:31:42.186
There might be one way around it.

00:31:47.926 --> 00:31:48.926
Mother, where are you?

00:31:49.666 --> 00:31:50.666
Why aren't you here yet?

00:31:51.126 --> 00:31:52.126
Gi Chan.

00:31:59.176 --> 00:32:01.506
- What are you doing here? - I'm representing your mother.

00:32:02.206 --> 00:32:04.706
She insisted that I come in her place.

00:32:06.516 --> 00:32:08.046
I'm not here as your wife.

00:32:08.446 --> 00:32:10.346
I'm here as Director Noh Sook Ja's representative.

00:32:17.226 --> 00:32:18.226
You'd better do this right.

00:32:18.486 --> 00:32:19.496
Don't worry.

00:33:17.246 --> 00:33:20.956
(Queen's House)

00:33:21.086 --> 00:33:22.956
Now that the news of a reinvestigation is out,

00:33:23.356 --> 00:33:25.656
it won't be long before the truth is revealed.

00:33:27.056 --> 00:33:28.056
"A reinvestigation?"

00:33:28.656 --> 00:33:30.396
There's news about a reinvestigation?

00:33:30.826 --> 00:33:32.836
I don't want to drive a company we've worked hard...

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:34.936
to grow together off a cliff.

00:33:35.936 --> 00:33:37.006
I don't need that.

00:33:38.036 --> 00:33:39.936
As we agreed, I want you out of YL Group.

00:33:41.036 --> 00:33:42.676
Please disregard Chairman Hwang's statement.

00:33:44.306 --> 00:33:46.846
What? They changed the prosecutor on the case?

00:33:47.546 --> 00:33:48.616
Detective...

00:33:50.046 --> 00:33:51.786
Please, save me.

00:33:53.016 --> 00:33:54.256
Please save me.

00:33:55.386 --> 00:33:56.486
Please save me.
