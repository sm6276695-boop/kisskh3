[Shadow Love]

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.960
[Episode 24]

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.150
You know so much about this matter.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.600
How could you not know

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.070
that Li Shuang has
someone

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.120
under her command who can

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.759
slay the enemy's leader amid
thousands of troops - the man in black?

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.000
You need not worry about that person.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.100
On the day of the heavenly calamity,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.740
he certainly won't appear before you.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.770
I'll also hand over
the Crown Prince to you,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.810
and then

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.450
you can do whatever you want with him.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.070
Why should I trust you?

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.420
Do you have a choice?

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.470
You did something to
the Taijin Emperor's golden elixir.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.340
I don't think
your father has much time left.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.450
When the time comes,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.930
the Emperor passes away
and the Crown Prince takes the throne.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.840
Will you still have a way out?

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.829
How did you come to know this?

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.610
Who exactly are you?

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.630
It doesn't matter who I am.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.430
Who you want to become

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.829
depends entirely

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.800
on you.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.060
Master.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.940
As long as Su Muyang restrains
the shadow puppet with the Kongqing Water,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.860
we can then discard him
once he's no longer useful.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.620
Why

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.560
do we need to do Prince Li this favor?

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.620
The Taijin Emperor
has only these two heirs.

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.070
As long as the two brothers
turn against each other,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.800
Taijin will surely fall into chaos.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.610
Your Highness.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.060
How are the preparations
for the altar coming along?

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.920
It will be completed in a few days.

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:51.829
The great cause

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.079
of the Yao State to conquer the realm

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.210
will soon be realized.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.300
[General's Residence]

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.310
Mo Yin has prepared some herbal medicine

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.450
for both external and internal use,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.209
so your wounds can heal faster.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.390
It is too hot.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.890
Let it cool down first.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.000
Hot?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.580
Are you afraid of it being too hot,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.450
or too bitter?

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.070
Actually,

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.770
I stole some sugar
from the kitchen a few days ago

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.900
that I was saving for myself as a treat.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.350
Since that's the case,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.150
I'll generously offer it to you.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.690
Earlier at the cliff in the forest,

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.460
I told you I wanted to grow old with you,

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.460
but you didn't give me a serious answer.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.040
Our hearts

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.430
are aligned,

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.710
and our bond is deep.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.810
You surely know

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.580
what I'm thinking.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.430
If that's so,

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.560
what are your plans for the future?

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.830
When do you plan to marry me?

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.940
What will we call each other
after marriage?

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.170
How many children should we have?

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.290
When the children grow up,

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.140
who will help with their studies
and who will teach them swordsmanship?

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.580
When we're old, should we
buy a large house in the city

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.110
or retire to the mountains?

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.080
General, you're truly forthright.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.920
These words

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.120
are usually spoken by men.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.810
I want to marry you.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.360
But

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.159
I still need to buy a house and some land.

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:41.600
You might not care,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.750
but I should at least be able to afford

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.810
a proper wedding sedan chair, right?

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.030
Give me more time.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.940
We've been together for so long

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.060
but haven't had any time to relax.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.620
Since the Crown Prince
is in the residence,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.480
I don't think there's any danger.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.230
Why don't we

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.590
take the opportunity
to go out for a while?

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.310
Usually all you think about

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:21.920
is defending the nation.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.750
Today,

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.740
why are you suddenly being so romantic?

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.530
I've been busy with
the Crown Prince's affairs,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.370
and I've neglected you.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.330
You need to give me a chance

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:34.810
to make it up to you.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.750
[I don't want]

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.159
[to look back someday]

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.250
[and feel only regret.]

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.050
There are so many people here.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.540
If you don't hold my hand tightly,

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.740
what if you lose me?

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.490
You're General Li.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.860
With everyone watching,

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.300
how dare I be so bold?

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600
Sometimes

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.640
I find myself wondering:

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.360
if one day

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.850
we also become an ordinary couple,

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.560
and our lives

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.920
are filled with
the mundane chores of daily existence,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.390
would we be like them,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.740
still able to remember

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.720
the joy of our first meeting?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.190
Our first meeting was somewhat awkward,

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.310
so

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.720
perhaps it's better forgotten.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:57.659
I...

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.620
Duan Aodeng, Prince Annan of Yao State,

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.020
achieved fame at a young age

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.200
with cunning military tactics.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.930
Li Wei,
Grand General of Cavalry of Taijin,

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.250
with glorious military achievements,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.309
unmatched in loyalty and bravery.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:34.730
Bravo!

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.890
They're talking about Grand General.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:38.049
That's my father.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.970
Who is Duan Aodeng?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
He's

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.280
the younger brother of Duan Aoze,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.520
the former ruler

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.510
of the Yao State.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.330
During the Battle of Lucheng,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.970
while the two armies
were fiercely fighting,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.920
Prince Annan disappeared
from the battlefield.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.590
The Yao Army suddenly fell into disarray,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.390
and soon after,

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.320
news came that
the Yao Emperor had died suddenly.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.960
Stop! Watch my spear!

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.500
Bravo!

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.010
Your Majesty!

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.270
Your Majesty!

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.790
I'm your brother.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:02.960
Who

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.920
are you?

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.590
Bravo!

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.230
Bravo! Wonderful!

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.020
Jin'an.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.760
Bravo!

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:19.210
Jin'an!

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.240
Jin'an!

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:20.970
Thank you.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:23.510
What's wrong?

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.770
What a good show!

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.550
So

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.920
in the end, the Yao people's

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.320
morale collapsed,

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.000
and the Changfeng Army
won a great victory.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.320
Grand General was indeed great

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.650
as the nation's finest commander.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.520
Whenever a war breaks out,

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.230
regardless of the outcome,

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:48.430
it's never what my father wanted to see.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.510
That war

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.830
caused heavy casualties on both sides,

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.280
with bodies scattered everywhere.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.480
Throughout history,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.440
in so-called wars,

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.970
there are never any true winners.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.890
Come again when you have time.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.230
If you two have enjoyed the show,

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.590
please spare some coins

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.920
so I can feed my family.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.870
This is too much.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.830
I can't possibly accept this.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.920
If you feel it's too much,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.040
perhaps

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.560
you can give us
one of these shadow puppets?

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.510
Of course.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.040
You're quite generous,

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.470
spending a string of coins

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:34.870
just for a shadow puppet.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.990
You've been eyeing it for a while, right?

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.990
Since you like it so much,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:46.710
it's yours.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:56.990
Why

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.160
do you always know what I'm thinking?

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.870
Maybe because I only have one heart,

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.160
and this heart of mine

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.320
happens to be with you.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:11.690
Then when you reach Wuling Mountain,

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.660
will your heart still be with me?

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.540
If I hadn't forced Mo Yin
to tell me the truth,

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.050
how long were you planning
to keep it from me?

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.080
Too many things have happened lately.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.090
I didn't want to worry you anymore.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.100
So,

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.610
you were planning to wait
until everything was over

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.200
and then leave without saying goodbye?

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.630
To bear all this alone?

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.080
That day on the cliff, you told me

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.630
I didn't have to endure everything alone

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.170
because you would be by my side.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:14.960
Why?

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.960
In your heart,

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:18.800
am I so weak

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.760
that I can't share this burden with you?

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.610
I didn't tell you before

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.900
because I couldn't believe it myself.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.250
Until Prince Li came that day,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.920
I realized I had indeed lost control.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.610
I went wild

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:43.710
and it rebounded on you.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.450
This is the last thing I wanted to see.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.310
I know my own physical condition,

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.660
and with Lu Xin here,

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.110
everything will be fine.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.370
Mo Yin is from Wuling Mountain,

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.770
and if even he can't help,

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.360
how long can Lu Xin's assistance last?

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:01.960
Besides,

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.590
what if something goes wrong

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:05.880
when removing

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.800
the Jade Linglong

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.610
and you get hurt?

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.110
So...

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.080
So

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.870
you plan to go with him alone?

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.010
When the Jade Linglong is removed,

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.280
all your past memories

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.280
will vanish.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.120
If you leave alone,

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.030
it's like saying goodbye to me forever.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.980
Everything from the past,

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.850
all those promises...

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.120
Does it all mean nothing now?

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.200
We have a blood pact between us.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.940
When everything settles,

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.880
I'll accompany you to Wuling Mountain.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.590
No.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.970
I can't let you put yourself in danger.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:07.430
But I am your blood master.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.270
Only when I'm by your side

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.720
can I prevent you from losing control.

It can also be arranged like this.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:00.640
No.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.940
What are you doing?

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.440
By order of Prince Li,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.480
to ensure the Crown Prince's safety,

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:14.790
[General's Residence]

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:15.920
from today onwards,

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.960
no one in the General's Residence
shall go out without permission.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.710
Whoever violates it

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.369
shall be executed on the spot.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.160
When did it become Su Muli's turn
to have the final say in Lucheng?

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.130
If you want to live,

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:24.849
get out now!

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.430
I'm just following orders.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.069
Please don't make this difficult, General.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.840
His Highness

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.470
also asked me to deliver a message to you.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.070
If you had truly
made up your mind to rebel,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.490
he would not have lived to this day.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.440
Even if you disregard your own safety,

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.510
you must consider

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.400
Grand General

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.400
and the young master in the capital.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.370
Your Highness.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.900
It's late and cold.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.920
You haven't fully recovered yet.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.290
You should rest early.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.850
With all this commotion outside,

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.410
how could I possibly sleep?

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.960
Su Muli is doing this

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.790
because he's just afraid
I'll try to escape again.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.530
He wants to trap me here

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.380
at his mercy.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.180
Your Highness,

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.560
though Prince Li is pressing hard,

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.440
as long as I live,

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.970
I'll definitely keep you safe and sound.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.000
General, aren't you tired of

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.310
these formal pleasantries yet?

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.030
You don't seem to like the novels

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.290
I brought you anymore.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.880
Instead, this lively shadow puppet

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.330
seems to suit your taste much better.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.110
I should have realized this earlier.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.440
I thought

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.170
the Brain-Devouring Powder
had taken effect

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.060
and you were dead somewhere.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.160
Without Your Majesty's decree,

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:42.550
I dare not die.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.420
I have arranged everything.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.350
Not only is the shadow puppet
under control,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.160
but even the two princes of Taijin

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.270
are dancing to my tune.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:30.120
Your Majesty.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.400
Right now

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.600
the Taijin Emperor is dying,

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.070
and those two princes

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.310
are trapped in their own power struggle,

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.770
tearing each other apart.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.800
Before long, Taijin will fall into chaos.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.550
You must trust me.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.440
When the time comes,

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.840
won't Taijin's throne

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.750
be ours for the taking?

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:50.750
Besides,

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.600
with our combined power,

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.800
what challenge does the Yao State pose?

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.100
What I promise you

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.030
is the entire world!

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.880
Who gave you permission
to wear His Majesty's old clothes?

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.800
Take them off!

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.370
Take them off!

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.480
Take them off!

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.320
Don't you understand

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:31.470
what I've been thinking all these years?

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.510
Why can't you accept me?

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.980
Even if I'm just a substitute.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.510
Are you

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:03.930
worthy?

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.100
I

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.340
take my leave.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.090
Your Highness,

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.570
this was found on the bed.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.830
It seems to be a message
from that person.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.020
On the night of the ninth,

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.960
in the dense forest outside the city,

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.920
fireworks will be the signal.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.360
Tomorrow is the day of the sacrifice,

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.160
and also the day
to make the final decision.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:22.660
I brought

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.960
this wine back from the capital.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:25.920
I was

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.510
planning to save it

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:29.060
and wait until
Ting takes over the Changfeng Army.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.860
Now we don't need to wait for him.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.190
You're in for a treat.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.950
What is done

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.230
cannot be undone.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.170
To choose to protect him

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.000
is to stand against the Emperor.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.310
Have you

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.690
weighed the consequences?

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.710
The astrological omens are baseless,

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:48.270
and killing his son is unconscionable.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.800
This so-called sacrifice,

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.780
if made public,

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.690
will only disturb the people.

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.030
His Majesty doesn't dare
issue a clear edict,

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.920
and I doubt that in court

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.760
he would speak of it openly.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.810
If this spreads,

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.960
it will show that
our Changfeng Army is loyal to duty

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.690
and supports the Crown Prince.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.810
You've thought of a way out for everyone,

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.090
yet

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.880
you're prepared to risk your own life.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.760
But whatever decision you make,

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:22.740
I will be by your side.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.260
Your Highness,

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.160
it's late.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.400
When Father named me as his heir,

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:44.270
I thought

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.840
he actually cared about
our father-son bond,

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.010
but couldn't express it
because of his high expectations.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.960
In truth,

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.690
I should have realized it long ago.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.550
Decades of indifference

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.200
won't change so easily.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.160
So all of this

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.640
was just to send me to my death.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.160
General Li used to value loyalty greatly.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.220
Perhaps she won't truly abandon you.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.640
And there's Jin'an.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.310
They did make me promises,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.880
but what happened?

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.820
They still betrayed me.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.990
Now,

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.270
I can only save myself.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.960
Life and death are in others' hands.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.550
All choices are poor ones.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.570
Instead of being controlled,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.270
I'd better change my fate.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.530
When I first saw you,

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.040
you were wearing this armor.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:06.680
I thought

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:08.600
you looked divine,

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.500
like an immortal descended to earth.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.120
I was

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.150
clearly in a terrible state.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:18.030
But you

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.200
appeared out of nowhere

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.840
and fought to protect me.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.870
Although we haven't known each other long,

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.270
it feels like it's been forever,

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.310
as if we've lived
several lifetimes together.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.790
In the future,

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.790
I'd rather live an ordinary life with you,

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:48.390
supporting each other
through thick and thin,

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.840
never to be separated.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.000
After this,

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:56.820
we will live

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.750
the life we want.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:04.230
General,

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:05.960
Huai'en requests an audience.

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:12.610
Greetings, General.

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:14.450
His Highness is concerned about
your recent hard work,

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:15.680
so he sent me

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.750
to invite you to join the festivities.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.920
I appreciate His Highness's kindness,

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.980
but please tell him

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.230
I have urgent matters to attend to.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.700
I'm merely delivering a message.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.550
Please don't put me
in a difficult position.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.030
His Highness has invited you sincerely.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.030
Why must you turn down his kindness?

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.030
Moreover,

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.390
His Highness specifically instructed

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:34.650
that Jin'an has rendered great service,

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.160
and must also be invited,

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.560
to show appreciation.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.360
Since His Highness insists so graciously,

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.760
I suppose I have no choice

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.190
but to follow orders.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:14.790
This Su Muyang

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.990
is facing death yet still thinking about
pleasure and entertainment?

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.230
What happens to the Crown Prince
is secondary,

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.690
but Li Shuang refuses to
let him go so easily.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:24.470
What should and shouldn't be said,

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.790
I have said it all.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:26.440
Yes.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.280
If she still remains stubborn,

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.860
then she cannot be spared.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.120
The auspicious time is approaching.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.600
How are the preparations coming along?

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.800
Everything is ready.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.020
We only await Your Highness's order.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.700
[Zang Mansion]

00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.650
My dear brother,

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.640
I won't let you die on the altar.

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.090
You can only die by my hand.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.890
[General's Residence]

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.160
Come on.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.170
Your Highness.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.930
That's enough.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.700
Your Highness.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.310
You've finally come.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.170
What are you dawdling for?

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:43.230
Invite our two honored guests

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.570
to take their seats.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:52.780
Why aren't you two sitting down?

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.700
Your Highness,

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:56.470
you've just recovered
from a serious illness.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:57.600
Even if you wish to enjoy yourself,

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.120
you shouldn't overindulge.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.120
You should take care of your health.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.200
When dawn breaks,

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.300
my time will be up.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.020
What's the point of
taking care of my health?

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:13.920
For the past twenty-some years,

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.070
I've lived in fear every day,

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:18.770
being cautious about every little thing.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:19.960
Looking back now,

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.550
it was all wasted.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:23.790
Since that's the case,

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.420
I might as well indulge myself

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.940
and truly enjoy myself one last time.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.580
As they say,
"Beneath the peony blooms I die,

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.640
Even as a ghost, romance shall not die."

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.700
By the way, Shuang,

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.460
I remember when we were children,

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.410
your dancing was exceptional.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.880
Today is a rare occasion for joy.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.640
Why don't you

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.680
simply show off

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.840
your dancing skills

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.500
and add to the entertainment?

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.760
General's skills

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.260
are meant for defending the country.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.550
Isn't your request

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:01.960
a bit demanding?

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.840
Defending the country?

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.510
Are you suggesting

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.820
that you're defying my order?

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.920
As long as I live another day,

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.550
I am still the Crown Prince.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.090
Whatever I say

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.470
is a royal command.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:27.490
If you dare to disobey,

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.080
it would be treason.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.560
General, what do you mean by this?

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:45.880
Since Your Highness

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.160
is in such a good mood,

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:49.030
then I

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:51.040
will have to humbly oblige.

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:34.360
Good.

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:45.710
Lady Dongfang's dance once
moved the entire kingdom.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:46.710
Today, General,

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.560
you are no less impressive
than Lady Dongfang.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.139
Bring the wine!

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.190
This glass

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.780
is raised first to

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.050
both of you

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:04.280
for your kindness
towards me these past days,

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.070
and second

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.150
to our youth.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.380
Though I cannot change it now,

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.250
I shall never forget it
for the rest of my days.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.680
What's wrong?

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:24.570
Are you afraid I might poison your drinks?

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:36.650
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.400
General!

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.120
General!

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.150
General!

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:18.120
Bad news, General!

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.180
Prince Li has brought his men inside.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:22.880
What's bound to come will come.

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.550
Everyone,

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:24.180
follow me!

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:24.850
Wait.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:28.390
Could Jin'an

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.420
stay by my side?

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:30.240
This way,

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.760
I would feel more at ease.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.990
I urge you

00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:57.740
to hand over Su Muyang.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.880
Otherwise,

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.320
I'll raze this place to the ground.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:11.880
Tonight,

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:15.320
this arrow is the boundary.

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.360
Whoever crosses it

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.950
shall be slain!

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:22.770
Attack!

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:11.070
How foolish.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.150
General Li, surely you don't think

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:14.280
that your man in black

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.140
still has the ability to save you?

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.370
There's fighting raging outside,

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:31.960
yet you remain so calm.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.860
I'm now in the General's Residence,

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.190
so we're all in the same boat.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.010
Li Shuang doesn't want me
to die in Lucheng

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.880
and implicate the Li family.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.440
To protect herself,

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.150
she'll fight desperately to keep me safe.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.570
Do you really think Shuang
risked her life for you repeatedly

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.500
just to protect the Li family
and the Changfeng Army?

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:05.730
I once thought so too,

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.280
but you were afraid of
getting yourself into trouble

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.990
and abandoned me like a worn-out shoe.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:12.030
Then I realized

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:13.720
it was time to wake up

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.280
from this dream.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.960
I understand.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.330
You helped me back then

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.380
only because of Li Shuang.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.030
Now that circumstances have changed,

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:30.690
you naturally want to help her

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:32.380
and get rid of me as a burden.

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.930
If that were really the case,

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.900
why would she have me take your carriage

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.100
to mislead Prince Li?

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:40.550
She could have just tied you up
and brought you to Prince Li.

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:41.830
Wouldn't that have been easier?

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:43.770
Shuang has been planning
extensively and buying time

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:44.190
just so she could

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:45.670
send you to a safe place,

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:48.440
at least to escape this immediate danger.

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:49.470
Right now,

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:51.870
she's still out there,

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:53.380
fighting for your life.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:54.260
And you?

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:56.680
You're resenting her.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:01.440
I cannot deny

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.720
that I have broken my promise to you.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.950
But Shuang often acts out of necessity.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.470
You grew up together.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.720
She sees you as her only brother,

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.670
her only friend.

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:13.400
Others may not understand her,

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.510
but don't you?

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:19.010
Thank you.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.400
I'm afraid all of this

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:25.960
is too late.
