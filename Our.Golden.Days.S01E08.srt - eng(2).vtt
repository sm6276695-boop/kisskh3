00:00:01.141 --> 00:00:02.911
(Episode 8)

00:00:03.981 --> 00:00:05.051
What...

00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:07.381
brings you here?

00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:09.791
Ji Eun Oh.

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:14.861
I have something to tell you.

00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:18.161
What...

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:22.100
No. You can't have anything to tell me.

00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:24.301
I do have something to say.

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.071
- What... - I'll spend the night here.

00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:33.941
What?

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:36.381
I'll spend the night at the cafe.

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:38.721
Are you out of your mind?

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:40.220
Why would you sleep here?

00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:41.221
Here?

00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:44.091
I believe this is Value of Hangyeol's hangout.

00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:46.861
I know some sleep here every now and then.

00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:48.761
People like you.

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:51.560
I'm the manager of this cafe.

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.231
You're a manager, not the owner.

00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:56.730
The manager has the authority...

00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:59.041
and duty to manage the space.

00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:02.611
I have nowhere to go.

00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:08.550
You have a family here,

00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:10.110
and there are hotels and motels...

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:11.381
I can't afford...

00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:14.251
to go anywhere else.

00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:16.891
Get home safely.

00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:19.021
What?

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:30.431
I'll give you money to go to a motel. Get out.

00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:34.001
You still think that little of me?

00:01:34.271 --> 00:01:36.170
You came without so much as a call...

00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:37.610
and demand to sleep here?

00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:39.080
It's a no, so get out.

00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:40.111
What if I don't?

00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:42.450
Will you drag me out?

00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:44.311
I said I'd give you money to go to a motel.

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:47.081
Why take your money when I can stay here?

00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:53.661
Hey.

00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:03.000
Did he come back with a screw loose?

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:04.431
It makes no sense.

00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:06.241
What's wrong with him?

00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:16.481
Darn it.

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:34.531
It's still cosy...

00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:37.131
and relaxing.

00:02:55.751 --> 00:02:58.121
How could he show up looking like that?

00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:01.891
I mean, how could he even show up in front of me?

00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:04.531
Does he think I'm a pushover or something?

00:03:04.731 --> 00:03:06.831
He must know that I can be coldhearted!

00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:08.831
But why?

00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:11.231
Why does he want to sleep at the cafe?

00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:13.341
If he's back, he should go home!

00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:16.741
How's he going to sleep there without any sheets?

00:03:20.881 --> 00:03:21.881
No way.

00:03:36.861 --> 00:03:38.531
Ji Eun Oh, that spiteful thing.

00:03:40.231 --> 00:03:41.661
The floor is so hard.

00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:47.801
And she slept here.

00:03:57.911 --> 00:04:01.991
(Cafe Agit)

00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:17.001
What? Did he use my sleeping bag?

00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:22.841
What?

00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:25.611
Did you clean up the storage?

00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:28.851
I guess he's in the bathroom.

00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:35.491
Hey.

00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:51.631
He didn't even move his stuff.

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.001
Who?

00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:55.240
Whose toothbrush is this?

00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:57.011
Does he think this is his own place?

00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.911
He left all his stuff here.

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:01.041
Where did he go?

00:05:01.081 --> 00:05:02.781
- Who are you talking about? - Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.480
What? Lee Ji Hyuk? Did he come here?

00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:07.651
He slept here last night.

00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:09.121
He slept here?

00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:11.421
What...

00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:14.790
Wait, Eun Oh. Where are you going? Hey!

00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:16.961
(Jung Hyeon Su Architecture Lab)

00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:24.701
I was surprised to hear that you came to see me.

00:05:25.071 --> 00:05:26.471
And the way you look is even more surprising.

00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:29.641
It's good to see you again, Ji Hyuk.

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.181
Is everything all right with you?

00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:36.711
What's with you? Why do you sound so polite?

00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:38.981
I don't know.

00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:41.451
You get ten minutes.

00:05:41.452 --> 00:05:43.651
I have a meeting with a client in 30 minutes.

00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:44.951
Will ten minutes do?

00:05:45.321 --> 00:05:46.460
- Sit. - Hyeon Su.

00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:47.521
Yes?

00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:51.961
I have an item I want to try again.

00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:54.060
I need an office.

00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:55.801
Could you let me use the storage room at Cafe Agit?

00:05:56.601 --> 00:05:57.731
As for the rent,

00:05:58.641 --> 00:05:59.941
I can pay 200 dollars per month.

00:06:00.301 --> 00:06:01.771
Are you planning to start a business?

00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:04.541
- Yes. - And?

00:06:06.541 --> 00:06:08.311
- And what? - What is the item?

00:06:08.851 --> 00:06:10.711
I can't tell you that in ten minutes.

00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:12.721
I'll tell you once I finish cleaning up the storage.

00:06:12.751 --> 00:06:14.751
So, you just want me to let you use the storage?

00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:16.591
That's it? It's no big deal.

00:06:17.021 --> 00:06:18.291
It didn't even take five minutes.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:21.591
I have one more favour to ask.

00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:29.631
Su Jeong.

00:06:30.001 --> 00:06:31.801
I have a meeting in the morning.

00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:33.170
Can I get an iced Americano to go?

00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:34.171
Sure.

00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:35.511
No.

00:06:36.341 --> 00:06:37.571
Don't talk to Eun Oh.

00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:43.681
Why? Is something wrong?

00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:46.280
Ji Hyuk barged in last night...

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.421
and slept in the storage room.

00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:48.991
Ji Hyuk came?

00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:51.291
- Is he there now? - No.

00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:53.620
When she came,

00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:55.121
he had already gone out, leaving his stuff here.

00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:04.301
Well... Then,

00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:06.601
can you call me right away when Ji Hyuk is back?

00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:09.371
- Okay. - I'll be back later for my coffee.

00:07:13.841 --> 00:07:15.451
(Cafe Agit)

00:07:29.191 --> 00:07:30.691
There's nothing worth keeping,

00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:33.131
but you can't throw them away without putting them in a trash bag.

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.101
Hello, Hyeon Su.

00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:40.241
I'm here to see you, Eun Oh.

00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:44.341
(Cafe Agit)

00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:55.791
Ji Hyuk is planning to start a business.

00:07:56.651 --> 00:07:59.061
He wanted to use the storage room as his office, so I said yes.

00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:02.531
His office?

00:08:03.961 --> 00:08:05.561
- Hyeon Su, that's... - Eun Oh.

00:08:06.131 --> 00:08:07.201
I...

00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:09.431
want to cut him some slack.

00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:11.971
You know what he's going through.

00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:14.571
He wants to do something, so I want to help him.

00:08:15.541 --> 00:08:18.141
He'll only use half the storage, and he'll pay rent too.

00:08:18.241 --> 00:08:19.711
You should get 200 dollars from him every month.

00:08:20.381 --> 00:08:23.081
Maybe he will do some work at the cafe,

00:08:23.351 --> 00:08:24.511
but he will at least buy coffee.

00:08:31.321 --> 00:08:32.891
You're the one who will feel most uncomfortable.

00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:37.560
When the cafe is closed, you use this place by yourself...

00:08:37.561 --> 00:08:39.201
as your office and your studio.

00:08:40.701 --> 00:08:41.761
But still,

00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:44.331
you two go way back.

00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:48.341
Please try to understand.

00:08:52.711 --> 00:08:54.881
Okay. I will.

00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:03.151
Ji Hyuk is back at the cafe.

(Chief Director Park Seong Jae)

00:09:19.941 --> 00:09:21.000
If you block this side,

00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:22.571
it'll be inconvenient to move materials in and out.

00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:24.241
I'll set things up so that won't be the case.

00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:26.111
Just wait until I'm done cleaning.

00:09:28.181 --> 00:09:29.281
What's the reason?

00:09:29.981 --> 00:09:32.951
Why did you show up here with Hyeon Su behind you?

00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:34.321
It's just as Hyeon Su said.

00:09:35.051 --> 00:09:36.850
I wanted to start a business and needed an office,

00:09:36.851 --> 00:09:37.951
but I didn't have enough money.

00:09:38.721 --> 00:09:40.661
And you want me to understand that?

00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:42.331
That's the situation I'm in.

00:09:54.071 --> 00:09:56.111
Hey, are you all right?

00:09:56.141 --> 00:09:57.171
I have to be.

00:09:57.671 --> 00:09:59.611
Hyeon Su is okay with this, so I have no choice.

00:09:59.781 --> 00:10:00.841
I know.

00:10:02.381 --> 00:10:04.051
Ji Hyuk is clever.

00:10:05.151 --> 00:10:07.181
But what kind of business does Ji Hyuk want to start?

00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:09.651
We have a customer.

00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:11.521
Okay.

00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:20.760
I'll have an iced Americano, please.

00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:21.901
That would be five dollars.

00:10:22.131 --> 00:10:23.971
- Here. - I'll get you the drink.

00:10:24.401 --> 00:10:26.171

It turns out you are Su Jeong's friend.

Let's go out.

I don't feel like eating. And I have some work to do.

No. You have to talk to me first.

- Park Seong Jae. - What happened?

00:12:41.871 --> 00:12:44.041
Are you asking me why I came back or why I'm here?

00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:47.081
Tell me exactly what you want to know.

00:12:47.281 --> 00:12:48.681
It's both!

00:12:49.111 --> 00:12:50.611
Why did you come back?

00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:52.010
I get that you had to come back.

00:12:52.011 --> 00:12:53.280
But why did you not tell me?

00:12:53.281 --> 00:12:54.581
And why are you here?

00:12:56.751 --> 00:12:58.391
You slept here last night?

00:13:00.391 --> 00:13:01.860
You want me to tell you everything?

00:13:01.861 --> 00:13:03.661
- Isn't it obvious? - How so?

00:13:03.931 --> 00:13:06.330
Why should I tell you everything right now?

00:13:06.331 --> 00:13:07.701
You're angry with me?

00:13:10.701 --> 00:13:11.731
I was...

00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:14.471
in the middle of something important.

00:13:16.011 --> 00:13:17.441
Can you give me my phone?

00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:20.011
If you want to talk, wait inside.

00:13:27.081 --> 00:13:28.121
You really...

00:13:43.731 --> 00:13:45.371
I shouldn't have told him.

00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:48.070
Why did you tell him?

00:13:48.071 --> 00:13:49.710
They're friends.

00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:51.771
He didn't tell him himself.

00:13:51.811 --> 00:13:52.911
Park Seong Jae.

00:13:53.781 --> 00:13:54.781
Seong Jae.

00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:00.720
Don't tell my family anything.

00:14:00.721 --> 00:14:02.490
You chased after me just to tell me that?

00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:03.521
Yes.

00:14:06.791 --> 00:14:07.961
Why should I?

00:14:08.091 --> 00:14:09.590
Why should I keep it from them?

00:14:09.591 --> 00:14:10.731
You have to.

00:14:11.431 --> 00:14:12.830
You have no right to tell.

00:14:12.831 --> 00:14:13.831
Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:14:14.331 --> 00:14:16.671
Do you know how long I've known your parents?

00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:19.441
How did you meet them in the first place?

00:14:20.201 --> 00:14:21.201
One,

00:14:21.441 --> 00:14:23.310
you shouldn't do what a friend doesn't want you to.

00:14:23.311 --> 00:14:24.311
Two,

00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:26.211
that's called being intrusive.

00:14:26.941 --> 00:14:29.211
You showed up without a single call.

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:31.411
What about the situation you're putting me in?

00:14:32.551 --> 00:14:35.150
Why complain when you just don't have to call them?

00:14:35.151 --> 00:14:36.251
Ji Wan...

00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:38.651
is my sister's temporary driver.

00:14:39.421 --> 00:14:40.421
And Su Bin...

00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:43.091
I'm doing something with her.

00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:46.201
Everyone's worried about you,

00:14:46.701 --> 00:14:48.931
and you expect me to lie to them?

00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:51.101
A lot happened...

00:14:53.401 --> 00:14:54.601
while I was away.

00:14:54.871 --> 00:14:56.210
Yes.

00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:59.241
You're way too inflexible. I'm not asking you to lie.

00:14:59.711 --> 00:15:01.041
Just don't say anything.

00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:04.281
For how long?

00:15:05.281 --> 00:15:08.051
I want to be the one to greet my family when I can.

00:15:08.821 --> 00:15:10.551
I don't want them to hear about me from someone else.

00:15:11.551 --> 00:15:13.561
"I'm back in Seoul, and I'm starting a business."

00:15:14.191 --> 00:15:16.761
"So don't worry about me. Just give me some time."

00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:20.231
If I say that, they'll ask questions I'm not ready to answer.

00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:21.631
Not yet.

00:15:22.001 --> 00:15:23.801
That's what you should've said.

00:15:25.301 --> 00:15:26.741
What business?

00:15:27.041 --> 00:15:29.041
What are you thinking about doing?

00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:32.210
Later.

00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:33.641
I have nothing to say just yet.

00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:36.011
I bet you think...

00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:38.251
I'm letting my ego talk.

00:15:40.021 --> 00:15:41.051
I'll be in touch.

00:15:51.831 --> 00:15:53.301
What is he thinking?

00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:58.401
You barely slept after the nightmare last night.

00:15:59.071 --> 00:16:00.901
Are you sleepy, or do you feel unwell?

00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:04.871
I'm tired. I just want to sleep.

00:16:06.241 --> 00:16:08.141
Stay in bed, then. I'm going out.

00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:11.150
I prepared lunch.

00:16:11.151 --> 00:16:12.880
Why don't you eat with Mother?

00:16:12.881 --> 00:16:15.181
No. I had a late breakfast, so I'm fine.

00:16:16.021 --> 00:16:17.751
- I'll see you later. - Yes, bye.

00:16:44.981 --> 00:16:46.721
This fool.

00:16:47.551 --> 00:16:49.990
He left the money as if he were in the right.

00:16:49.991 --> 00:16:52.921
How could he think of moving into the woman's house with nothing?

00:16:58.891 --> 00:17:00.561
- You're still here? - What?

00:17:02.801 --> 00:17:03.901
What's that?

00:17:04.731 --> 00:17:05.941
It's nothing.

00:17:06.701 --> 00:17:07.870
I asked what that was.

00:17:07.871 --> 00:17:09.101
- Let me see. - No.

00:17:10.111 --> 00:17:11.241
They're...

00:17:11.811 --> 00:17:14.781
They're the checks I gave to Ji Hyuk.

00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:18.351
You mean the 80,000 dollars?

00:17:18.951 --> 00:17:21.080
He added 20,000 of his own money...

00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:22.691
to make it 100,000 dollars...

00:17:23.051 --> 00:17:24.520
and left it under his pillow.

00:17:24.521 --> 00:17:27.291
I found it on the morning of his wedding day.

00:17:28.861 --> 00:17:31.291
And you didn't tell me?

00:17:32.491 --> 00:17:34.661
But... How come...

00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:36.601
I thought...

00:17:37.001 --> 00:17:39.501
he had that much money with him.

00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:41.600
So I thought he was travelling abroad...

00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:43.641
or in the countryside to clear his head.

00:17:44.371 --> 00:17:45.911
That's why I was holding back.

00:17:46.381 --> 00:17:47.881
That's why I was waiting.

00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:51.211
You knew that...

00:17:51.681 --> 00:17:53.451
and you didn't tell me, honey?

00:17:54.081 --> 00:17:57.091
You'd have worried yourself sick if I'd told you.

00:17:57.391 --> 00:17:59.921
No. I would've...

00:18:00.921 --> 00:18:02.361
No.

00:18:03.761 --> 00:18:06.261
I'd have called him every day.

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.600
To tell him to come home safely.

00:18:08.601 --> 00:18:10.230
I'd have left voicemails and texts,

00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:12.100
begged, and pleaded.

00:18:12.101 --> 00:18:13.701
I'd have done that every day.

00:18:14.401 --> 00:18:16.141
I had no idea.

00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:18.070
He can't come home even if he wants to,

00:18:18.071 --> 00:18:19.981
if he thinks his parents don't want him back.

00:18:20.381 --> 00:18:22.581
He wouldn't have the courage to come back.

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.421
Should he have to work to make money just to eat?

00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:28.750
He doesn't need this money to survive.

00:18:28.751 --> 00:18:31.591
He'd even prepared to move out.

00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:33.491
Why worry?

00:18:34.191 --> 00:18:35.561
Mr. Lee!

00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:37.960
Didn't you hear what I said?

00:18:37.961 --> 00:18:40.661
I don't have a son called Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:44.430
You don't. I see that now.

00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:46.541
He's just as stubborn as you!

00:18:48.671 --> 00:18:51.771
He was standing by a river of all things.

00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:53.611
Ji Hyuk...

00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:56.881
was standing there crying in silence.

00:18:57.551 --> 00:18:59.920
I called and shouted to him.

00:18:59.921 --> 00:19:03.151
I said, "Come here. Come over here, Ji Hyuk."

00:19:04.191 --> 00:19:06.921
But he didn't move.

00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:12.131
You didn't tell me in case I got angry?

00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:15.300
What did you think as you saw me calm and relaxed...

00:19:15.301 --> 00:19:17.771
because I thought he had some money?

00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:19.641
I shouldn't be here doing nothing.

00:19:20.341 --> 00:19:22.170
Good for you.

00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:23.871
Like father, like son.

00:19:24.411 --> 00:19:26.380
He's no longer your son?

00:19:26.381 --> 00:19:28.681
I don't feel the same. He's still my son!

00:19:30.281 --> 00:19:32.281
I dreamed of him last night...

00:19:32.481 --> 00:19:34.721
and couldn't sleep a wink afterward.

00:19:35.921 --> 00:19:36.921
Da Jeong.

00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:42.291
Did you have a dream about Ji Hyuk too?

00:19:43.061 --> 00:19:44.061
Mother.

00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:47.261
A bad dream, right? Mine was too.

00:19:47.901 --> 00:19:50.331
Sang Cheol. About Ji Hyuk.

00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:52.531
Should we report him missing?

00:19:52.601 --> 00:19:53.770
Mother, please.

00:19:53.771 --> 00:19:56.441
What if he's too ashamed...

00:19:56.671 --> 00:19:58.640
and can't think of what to do?

00:19:58.641 --> 00:19:59.681
Mother.

00:20:00.441 --> 00:20:01.841
What does that mean?

00:20:02.751 --> 00:20:04.711
Ji Hyuk's not that weak.

00:20:05.011 --> 00:20:08.681
How can you be so calm when you're his parents?

00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:12.421
I'm going to the police.

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:14.461
Stay right there, Mother!

00:20:19.601 --> 00:20:21.061
Ji Hyuk is my son.

00:20:21.701 --> 00:20:23.331
Did you give birth to him?

00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:26.031
How do you think I feel?

00:20:26.241 --> 00:20:29.571
Do you think you're more worried about him than I am?

00:20:30.571 --> 00:20:32.881
Why would you say something so negative?

00:20:33.581 --> 00:20:34.641
Da Jeong.

00:20:35.181 --> 00:20:36.681
He's human too.

00:20:37.351 --> 00:20:38.981
How could he reappear...

00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:41.451
in a couple of months after being treated like that?

00:20:42.481 --> 00:20:45.451
He can't. No one could.

00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:51.631
Do you think I feel fine? That I don't mind at all?

00:21:01.401 --> 00:21:02.771
I tell myself...

00:21:03.411 --> 00:21:05.141
he wouldn't do that.

00:21:06.541 --> 00:21:07.780
But my heart...

00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:10.281
drops to the floor a million times a day.

00:21:12.151 --> 00:21:13.751
I still force myself to wait.

00:21:14.121 --> 00:21:16.191
How could she even consider reporting him missing?

00:21:18.321 --> 00:21:20.621
Ji Hyuk said he'd come back.

00:21:21.021 --> 00:21:23.791
He told me he'd come back.

00:21:35.241 --> 00:21:36.241
Yes.

00:21:37.471 --> 00:21:38.541
Da Jeong is...

00:21:40.441 --> 00:21:41.911
She's his mom.

00:21:42.611 --> 00:21:43.981
And she held back.

00:21:44.651 --> 00:21:46.281
She kept it bottled up.

00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:51.051
I thought she was indifferent,

00:21:52.151 --> 00:21:55.621
and that I was the only one feeling scared and anxious.

00:21:57.991 --> 00:21:59.461
Of course, that's not the case.

00:22:00.631 --> 00:22:02.331
She's his mom.

00:22:06.771 --> 00:22:09.511
Did you have plans, Father?

00:22:10.011 --> 00:22:11.441
No.

00:22:12.411 --> 00:22:15.241
I was just about to go out for a walk out of boredom.

00:22:23.791 --> 00:22:26.621
I'm 87 years old, and I've seen and heard...

00:22:27.161 --> 00:22:29.291
a great many odd things.

00:22:30.091 --> 00:22:31.961
Anything can happen.

00:22:34.801 --> 00:22:35.801
Father.

00:22:37.201 --> 00:22:38.271
Yes.

00:22:41.971 --> 00:22:44.771
What kind of state would Ji Hyuk be in?

00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:48.741
Are you crying?

00:22:51.511 --> 00:22:52.751
Father.

00:23:11.871 --> 00:23:13.101
You're getting a call.

00:23:16.241 --> 00:23:17.341
Let it ring.

00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:18.971
I'm sure it's just Sang Cheol.

00:23:19.681 --> 00:23:22.281
It's not. There's only a phone number.

00:23:29.081 --> 00:23:30.191
Hello?

00:23:30.751 --> 00:23:33.221
Mom, this is Ji Hyuk.

00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:38.931
Oh, hey. Just a second.

00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:49.711
Hey, Ji Hyuk. Have you been well?

00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:52.511
Yes.

00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:55.411
I called, figuring you'd worry.

00:23:57.111 --> 00:23:58.581
I see.

00:23:59.151 --> 00:24:00.681
I'm glad you did, my eldest son.

00:24:02.581 --> 00:24:03.691
Mom.

00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:05.291
Yes?

00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:08.721
It's nothing.

00:24:09.521 --> 00:24:11.231
You don't have to worry about me,

00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:14.731
but I still need some more time.

00:24:15.461 --> 00:24:18.031
Of course. As you should.

00:24:18.731 --> 00:24:20.041
Are you healthy and well?

00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:22.441
I am, and I've been eating my meals.

00:24:22.901 --> 00:24:24.341
Please tell Grandma that.

00:24:24.941 --> 00:24:26.011
Got it.

00:24:27.581 --> 00:24:29.041
I really want to ask...

00:24:29.581 --> 00:24:32.211
where you are and when you'll be back,

00:24:33.021 --> 00:24:35.021
but I doubt it would matter to you.

00:24:36.391 --> 00:24:38.621
Of course. You always know how to read the room.

00:24:39.391 --> 00:24:42.061
You'll be back when it's time, right?

00:24:43.431 --> 00:24:44.461
Sure, Mother.

00:24:46.501 --> 00:24:48.531
All right, then.

00:24:52.731 --> 00:24:54.701
Sang Cheol said he'd be here.

00:24:56.071 --> 00:24:57.640
Look. There he is.

00:24:57.641 --> 00:24:58.671
Goodness.

00:25:00.011 --> 00:25:01.081
Father.

00:25:02.281 --> 00:25:05.211
I'm sorry that Ji Hyuk and I are being a bother.

00:25:05.351 --> 00:25:07.081
There's no need to apologise.

00:25:08.081 --> 00:25:10.151
It's not like you need to save face with me.

00:25:11.391 --> 00:25:13.491
A job cancellation can happen to anyone.

00:25:14.461 --> 00:25:16.861
Here, have this and regain your energy.

00:25:17.131 --> 00:25:18.831
Gosh, Father, please save it for yourself.

00:25:20.201 --> 00:25:23.401
Take it. He's had it for some time now.

00:25:25.871 --> 00:25:27.501
Sure. Thank you, Father.

00:25:28.871 --> 00:25:31.471
By the way, why are you here?

00:25:32.341 --> 00:25:34.411
Why were you on a call outside?

00:25:35.081 --> 00:25:36.211
It's nothing you need to know about.

00:25:37.351 --> 00:25:38.651
Take her home already.

00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:46.091
You must've cried in front of your father,

00:25:46.121 --> 00:25:47.321
seeing how you seem less angry.

00:25:49.221 --> 00:25:50.891
Ji Hyuk called a moment ago.

00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:54.061
He's fine.

00:25:54.831 --> 00:25:56.671
He's fine, so we shouldn't worry.

00:25:57.431 --> 00:25:58.501
Was that the call from earlier?

00:25:59.071 --> 00:26:00.071
Yes.

00:26:01.741 --> 00:26:03.841
He sounded good on the phone,

00:26:05.041 --> 00:26:07.311
which made me feel a lot better.

00:26:08.611 --> 00:26:10.981
What could you do if he wasn't okay? This is the bed he chose to make.

00:26:12.551 --> 00:26:14.081
Whether he was right or not,

00:26:14.921 --> 00:26:16.691
you know this is much harder on him.

00:26:17.321 --> 00:26:19.191
Regardless of what you think of him,

00:26:19.861 --> 00:26:21.161
I'm still disappointed in him.

00:26:43.721 --> 00:26:44.721
What are you up to?

00:26:45.321 --> 00:26:48.051
I forgot to do the books yesterday because he barged in.

00:26:49.461 --> 00:26:50.521
Min Ho,

00:26:50.691 --> 00:26:52.491
check the scones to see if the numbers match.

00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:53.591
Sure.

00:26:57.201 --> 00:26:58.501
- Right this way. - Got it.

00:26:58.761 --> 00:27:00.401
He must've already bought a desk.

00:27:02.171 --> 00:27:03.940
The beer box is filled with empty bottles now,

00:27:03.941 --> 00:27:05.001
so take out the trash.

00:27:05.241 --> 00:27:06.241
Sure.

00:27:12.081 --> 00:27:13.651
Have you already bought a desk?

00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:15.950
Yes, someone was selling all his office supplies...

00:27:15.951 --> 00:27:18.021
after closing his office, so I bought them all.

00:27:18.221 --> 00:27:19.251
Secondhand?

00:27:19.521 --> 00:27:21.651
Wait, were all of these secondhand?

00:27:55.651 --> 00:27:57.061
What's this?

00:27:58.991 --> 00:28:00.031
A folding cot.

00:28:00.161 --> 00:28:01.561
I'll work and sleep here.

00:28:02.231 --> 00:28:04.161
Sleep here?

00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:06.031
Are you saying you'll live here?

00:28:06.631 --> 00:28:07.631
Yes.

00:28:08.801 --> 00:28:11.541
All of this for 200 dollars? You hit the jackpot.

00:28:16.311 --> 00:28:17.481
We need to talk.

00:28:26.891 --> 00:28:29.361
Is this why you went to Hyeon Su directly?

00:28:29.861 --> 00:28:31.461
So that I couldn't object?

00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:34.391
Yes.

00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:36.931
Were you always this selfish?

00:28:39.971 --> 00:28:42.231
I thought you already knew the worst about me,

00:28:42.671 --> 00:28:43.700
given what you said.

00:28:43.701 --> 00:28:45.340
What you really wanted...

00:28:45.341 --> 00:28:47.241
was wealth and status.

00:28:47.511 --> 00:28:48.571
That's all.

00:28:48.841 --> 00:28:50.910
But you pretended otherwise, as if you righteously sided...

00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:52.111
with the little guys...

00:28:52.211 --> 00:28:54.411
and stayed unmarried to remain free.

00:28:54.611 --> 00:28:56.621
I'm furious that you lied to me all this time.

00:28:56.781 --> 00:28:58.180
The person I liked the most...

00:28:58.181 --> 00:29:00.351
turned out to be the very kind of person I despise.

00:29:00.721 --> 00:29:03.061
That's why I'm regretting everything I did for you,

00:29:03.161 --> 00:29:05.821
not knowing who you really were. I'll even forget about the way...

00:29:06.021 --> 00:29:07.431
you faked our friendship too,

00:29:07.531 --> 00:29:08.861
so don't acknowledge me anymore.

00:29:09.631 --> 00:29:11.331
I thought I made myself clear,

00:29:12.201 --> 00:29:14.301
yet you still managed to annoy me again.

00:29:14.901 --> 00:29:17.771
Are you saying I should put up with you day and night?

00:29:17.901 --> 00:29:19.611
You know how I feel about you,

00:29:19.811 --> 00:29:22.880
and you also know I sometimes spend the night here working.

00:29:22.881 --> 00:29:25.041
When you stay the night here, working or sleeping,

00:29:25.611 --> 00:29:27.551
I'll be as quiet as a mouse in the office.

00:29:29.311 --> 00:29:31.180
Are you suggesting we both stay here at night?

00:29:31.181 --> 00:29:33.451
Consider me a stranger and pretend I'm invisible.

00:29:33.991 --> 00:29:36.161
I'll do my best to move out as soon as possible,

00:29:36.261 --> 00:29:37.391
but I can't promise anything.

00:29:37.521 --> 00:29:38.820
You asked the landlady for a favour...

00:29:38.821 --> 00:29:40.291
to keep me from doing anything,

00:29:40.831 --> 00:29:42.361
and I'm supposed to act like you're invisible?

00:29:44.331 --> 00:29:45.631
It's just what I expected from you.

00:30:02.351 --> 00:30:04.250
You're lucky you only have a headache.

00:30:04.251 --> 00:30:06.081
This is enough to drive someone crazy.

00:30:07.291 --> 00:30:08.921
How come the day is so long?

00:30:09.291 --> 00:30:11.021
Go and talk to Hyeon Su yourself.

00:30:11.491 --> 00:30:13.161
Tell her the issue you have with him.

00:30:14.331 --> 00:30:16.061
It'd be faster to quit.

00:30:16.131 --> 00:30:17.131
Hey.

00:30:20.101 --> 00:30:21.101
What?

00:30:29.171 --> 00:30:31.311
He must be serious about starting his own business.

00:30:31.781 --> 00:30:34.051
I wonder what he's planning to do now that he's moved in here.

00:30:34.811 --> 00:30:36.351
Darn it.

00:30:38.121 --> 00:30:39.281
Will you be all right?

00:30:40.951 --> 00:30:42.551
I'll pretend he's invisible.

00:30:43.261 --> 00:30:44.991
That's what he also wants.

00:30:47.261 --> 00:30:48.360
This is suffocating.

00:30:48.361 --> 00:30:50.231
Min Ho, can you take a shift this weekend?

00:30:50.331 --> 00:30:51.531
I need to cut back on my time here.

00:30:58.241 --> 00:31:01.511
By the way, when's the exhibition?

00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:04.781
Soon.

00:31:05.711 --> 00:31:08.111
Exactly. So when is it?

00:31:10.081 --> 00:31:11.351
Why are you asking?

00:31:12.021 --> 00:31:13.351
Am I not allowed to ask?

00:31:13.491 --> 00:31:16.091
It's not something a chauffeur should ask.

00:31:16.261 --> 00:31:17.261
What?

00:31:17.961 --> 00:31:19.191
What did you just call me?

00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:22.061
- A chauffeur? - Yes.

00:31:26.871 --> 00:31:28.301
Has your family still not hired a chauffeur?

00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:31.141
I haven't heard anything from my parents.

00:31:31.241 --> 00:31:34.071
Hey, I'm not your chauffeur.

00:31:34.311 --> 00:31:36.341
I'm driving you around for now...

00:31:36.541 --> 00:31:37.911
as a favour to Seong Jae.

00:31:38.541 --> 00:31:40.380
You're close to my sister's age,

00:31:40.381 --> 00:31:42.551
so I took the job to help out someone like a sibling.

00:31:43.121 --> 00:31:45.121
How dare you act like my boss?

00:31:45.551 --> 00:31:48.021
Hey, I've been letting it slide,

00:31:48.051 --> 00:31:49.560
but if I had known you were so haughty and naughty,

00:31:49.561 --> 00:31:52.021
I wouldn't have taken the job, no matter how hard Seong Jae begged.

00:31:53.031 --> 00:31:55.431
My mom calls you a chauffeur.

00:31:56.361 --> 00:31:57.461
She does?

00:31:57.731 --> 00:32:00.171
That's too bad. I don't want to be a chauffeur.

00:32:00.871 --> 00:32:02.871
- What? - You know how to drive, right?

00:32:03.941 --> 00:32:04.941
Yes.

00:32:10.381 --> 00:32:12.181
Then you should drive yourself home.

00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:13.411
I'm not doing this.

00:32:26.361 --> 00:32:27.691
My goodness.

00:32:28.431 --> 00:32:30.531
What's wrong with her?

00:32:30.631 --> 00:32:32.260
She never says hello to me.

00:32:32.261 --> 00:32:34.031
Whenever I talk to her, she pretends she didn't hear me.

00:32:34.871 --> 00:32:37.701
Fine. So, she thought I was a chauffeur.

00:32:38.241 --> 00:32:39.570
That's not going to happen.

00:32:39.571 --> 00:32:41.440
The pay was good, and the family seemed nice,

00:32:41.441 --> 00:32:42.941
so I was going to hold out,

00:32:43.711 --> 00:32:46.081
but I just can't put up with that rude brat.

00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:47.981
Darn it!

00:32:51.881 --> 00:32:54.350
There was a stalker, who was really threatening,

00:32:54.351 --> 00:32:55.591
and he hasn't been caught yet.

00:32:56.361 --> 00:32:58.391
Yeong Ra was really shocked and traumatized.

00:32:59.161 --> 00:33:00.361
Traumatized, my foot.

00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:03.061
She's just arrogant.

00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:06.871
Ji Wan, I can trust you and leave her in your care.

00:33:07.571 --> 00:33:08.731
Take good care of her.

00:33:11.541 --> 00:33:12.671
Darn it.

00:33:15.541 --> 00:33:16.741
Gosh, seriously...

00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:28.721
What?

00:33:35.691 --> 00:33:36.961
What is she doing?

00:33:39.301 --> 00:33:40.571
Hey, open it.

00:33:41.771 --> 00:33:43.371
Hey. Open the door.

00:33:46.511 --> 00:33:47.611
Hey, Park Yeong Ra.

00:34:02.821 --> 00:34:03.821
You...

00:34:04.661 --> 00:34:06.691
You are really terrified.

00:34:12.031 --> 00:34:15.101
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

00:34:17.471 --> 00:34:18.541
Well...

00:34:21.571 --> 00:34:22.871
Open the door.

00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:30.251
I'm sorry.

00:34:31.651 --> 00:34:32.651
Well...

00:34:33.951 --> 00:34:35.051
I'm sorry.

00:34:40.431 --> 00:34:43.361
I'm sorry too.

00:34:45.001 --> 00:34:46.231
Did she say sorry?

00:35:02.051 --> 00:35:03.481
Did you learn sign language?

00:35:03.621 --> 00:35:05.281
When? Why?

00:35:05.481 --> 00:35:06.790
It's been over ten minutes.

00:35:06.791 --> 00:35:08.221
Mom will call soon.

00:35:08.691 --> 00:35:11.291
The cars on the streets of Seoul can't operate like subways.

00:35:11.361 --> 00:35:13.131
We haven't moved for ten minutes.

00:35:14.461 --> 00:35:15.931
So what?

00:35:18.961 --> 00:35:20.001
Oh, right.

00:35:20.371 --> 00:35:23.841
There could be a minor accident.

00:35:27.171 --> 00:35:28.241
All right.

00:35:28.611 --> 00:35:30.911
I guess they are people from another world.

00:35:35.381 --> 00:35:36.451
Fasten your seat belt.

00:35:46.491 --> 00:35:47.931
Hey, Yeong Ra.

00:35:48.791 --> 00:35:51.061
Will you keep calling me a chauffeur?

00:35:51.631 --> 00:35:54.700
Your mom is aware that I'm Seong Jae's friend's brother,

00:35:54.701 --> 00:35:55.701
but she calls me a chauffeur?

00:35:56.301 --> 00:35:58.370
Just because you have a younger sister my age,

00:35:58.371 --> 00:36:00.171
it doesn't mean...

00:36:01.311 --> 00:36:02.411
you are my older brother.

00:36:02.571 --> 00:36:03.641
I see.

00:36:04.181 --> 00:36:06.441
So, that's how it is in the world where you live.

00:36:08.211 --> 00:36:10.551
Okay. I get it.

00:36:10.681 --> 00:36:12.051
You can call me Chauffeur Lee.

00:36:12.881 --> 00:36:16.761
Then do you want me to call you Ms. Park?

00:36:16.821 --> 00:36:19.120
No. You don't have to do that.

00:36:19.121 --> 00:36:20.431
Hey, Ms. Ko is here.

00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:35.710
What took you so long?

00:36:35.711 --> 00:36:37.381
There was a minor accident.

00:36:37.511 --> 00:36:40.151
It wasn't us. It was the car far ahead of us.

00:36:44.051 --> 00:36:46.921
Yeong Ra, did the car come to a sudden stop?

00:36:47.151 --> 00:36:48.421
Are you not hurt?

00:36:49.551 --> 00:36:50.591
No.

00:36:50.721 --> 00:36:54.461
It wasn't us. It was the car far ahead of us.

00:36:55.161 --> 00:36:57.961
I see. That's a relief.

00:36:59.801 --> 00:37:01.001
Thank you.

00:37:01.631 --> 00:37:03.101
All right. Let's go in.

00:37:04.971 --> 00:37:06.401
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:37:14.111 --> 00:37:16.721
My goodness. What a drama queen.

00:37:19.921 --> 00:37:21.791
- Dad, I'm home. - Hey.

00:37:24.021 --> 00:37:25.921
You seem chipper today.

00:37:26.021 --> 00:37:27.291
Did something good happen?

00:37:27.661 --> 00:37:28.991
It was just like yesterday.

00:37:29.591 --> 00:37:30.931
Was the chauffeur okay?

00:37:31.561 --> 00:37:33.500
You said the same thing yesterday.

00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:34.971
And the day before yesterday.

00:37:35.201 --> 00:37:37.201
I'm just worried.

00:37:38.641 --> 00:37:40.570
If you don't trust Seong Jae's friend's brother,

00:37:40.571 --> 00:37:42.611
how are you going to trust a new driver?

00:37:43.611 --> 00:37:45.481
Did you find a new driver?

00:37:46.711 --> 00:37:47.850
If it were that easy,

00:37:47.851 --> 00:37:49.280
we wouldn't have had to get a temporary driver.

00:37:49.281 --> 00:37:51.351
And it's Seong Jae's friend's brother, of all people.

00:37:51.921 --> 00:37:54.751
Seong Jae recommended him. What's the problem?

00:37:56.661 --> 00:38:00.091
It would be better to have a stranger work for us.

00:38:00.431 --> 00:38:01.761
You said that too.

00:38:02.291 --> 00:38:04.860
If we made a mistake or did something to upset him,

00:38:04.861 --> 00:38:06.771
it would cause Seong Jae to lose face.

00:38:07.771 --> 00:38:10.741
You wouldn't do anything that would embarrass Seong Jae.

00:38:11.901 --> 00:38:14.441
Your mom can be a bit too cautious sometimes.

00:38:15.411 --> 00:38:18.210
Right. I'll be in my room.

00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:19.211
- Okay. - Okay.

00:38:30.521 --> 00:38:32.121
Oh, dear.

00:38:34.161 --> 00:38:35.291
Here.

00:38:35.961 --> 00:38:37.031
It's ready.

00:38:37.501 --> 00:38:39.630
My goodness.

00:38:39.631 --> 00:38:41.701
I just can't thank you enough.

00:38:42.271 --> 00:38:45.240
How come you never miss a day ironing my underwear?

00:38:45.241 --> 00:38:47.710
Are you not sick of saying that?

00:38:47.711 --> 00:38:49.311
You'll get calluses in your mouth.

00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:51.980
As I always say, this is no big deal.

00:38:51.981 --> 00:38:54.481
It's your underwear. My husband's underwear.

00:38:54.681 --> 00:38:57.521
The first thing that touches your body should feel fresh.

00:38:58.551 --> 00:39:01.391
And this is your work outfit for today. What do you think?

00:39:03.421 --> 00:39:05.321
My wife, Ko Seong Hui.

00:39:05.991 --> 00:39:07.761
You are such a consistent person.

00:39:09.161 --> 00:39:11.161
I like everything you recommend.

00:39:11.601 --> 00:39:13.671
But you always ask for my opinion.

00:39:15.571 --> 00:39:18.200
You're a truly amazing woman.

00:39:18.201 --> 00:39:20.710
My gosh. You always compliment me like that,

00:39:20.711 --> 00:39:22.811
so that makes me want to try harder.

00:39:23.211 --> 00:39:26.011
Mr. Park Jin Seok, you know how to control me.

00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:28.910
Go ahead and get changed. I'll go check on Yeong Ra.

00:39:28.911 --> 00:39:29.981
Okay.

00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:39.290
Look.

00:39:39.291 --> 00:39:41.160
Yeong Ra, you look puffy.

00:39:41.161 --> 00:39:42.531
Why is that?

00:39:42.961 --> 00:39:45.901
There's no way you ate anything other than the salad I gave you.

00:39:46.331 --> 00:39:47.901
I didn't eat anything else.

00:39:50.901 --> 00:39:52.571
Have you been stretching every morning?

00:39:53.071 --> 00:39:55.141
Did you sleep on your stomach?

00:39:55.571 --> 00:39:58.241
Don't tell me you took a nap in the studio.

00:39:59.041 --> 00:40:00.151
I didn't.

00:40:01.111 --> 00:40:03.151
Then why is that?

00:40:04.551 --> 00:40:07.321
I can't lie down on the sofa in the studio even for a moment.

00:40:09.791 --> 00:40:12.961
Do I have to stay close to Ms. Jang the whole time like this?

00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:15.230
I think Ms. Jang can paint in her studio...

00:40:15.231 --> 00:40:16.931
and bring it like she used to do.

00:40:18.131 --> 00:40:19.561
Have you forgotten already?

00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:22.671
The stalker hasn't been caught yet.

00:40:23.541 --> 00:40:25.971
What if he's secretly watching you?

00:40:26.571 --> 00:40:29.311
What if he sees the canvases being moved around?

00:40:32.811 --> 00:40:35.811
I told you nothing in life is given for free.

00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:39.221
Nothing comes without sacrifice and effort.

00:40:39.821 --> 00:40:41.521
You know this is all for your sake.

00:40:41.891 --> 00:40:44.161
All of this is for your future.

00:40:45.961 --> 00:40:47.531
You are right, Mom.

00:40:51.401 --> 00:40:52.631
I should stop here.

00:40:54.201 --> 00:40:57.341
Nagging my brilliant daughter for too long...

00:40:58.401 --> 00:41:00.411
will only hurt her pride.

00:41:06.181 --> 00:41:10.821
(Gaon Foundation)

00:41:28.671 --> 00:41:31.571
Secretary Ko, are you wearing the perfume again?

00:41:32.101 --> 00:41:33.771
No, I'm not.

00:41:34.911 --> 00:41:37.611
I can smell it. If you say you are not wearing it, it's a lie.

00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:43.281
And you don't have the guts to lie to me.

00:41:47.851 --> 00:41:49.791
So, you mixed it with fabric softener.

00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:53.221
Yes. It was too good to throw away.

00:41:54.531 --> 00:41:57.830
Hey. I gave you another bottle of perfume.

00:41:57.831 --> 00:41:59.201
Throw away your old one.

00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:03.131
It's fraud if you keep wearing the old perfume.

00:42:06.141 --> 00:42:08.071
Don't show that you're poor.

00:42:08.971 --> 00:42:10.381
Did I give it to you for your sake?

00:42:11.011 --> 00:42:12.841
I gave it to you to save my nose.

00:42:15.011 --> 00:42:16.480
Get changed immediately.

00:42:16.481 --> 00:42:17.521
Yes, Ms. Ko.

00:42:18.621 --> 00:42:20.451
You got the list of galleries the Soryu members...

00:42:20.551 --> 00:42:22.250
do business with and their curators, right?

00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:23.321
Bring that to me.

00:42:23.821 --> 00:42:26.361
Right, with the catalogue of the artworks they own.

00:42:26.521 --> 00:42:27.561
Yes, Ms. Ko.

00:42:32.931 --> 00:42:34.871
- Thank you. - Thanks. Goodbye.

00:42:35.471 --> 00:42:36.530
Hello.

00:42:36.531 --> 00:42:38.341
Hey. Long time no see.

00:42:38.641 --> 00:42:39.671
Hi, Hye Na.

00:42:40.571 --> 00:42:41.741
Are you meeting a friend here?

00:42:41.871 --> 00:42:44.681
No. I'm here to meet my senior, Lee Ji Hyuk.

00:42:45.511 --> 00:42:46.581
What for?

00:42:46.781 --> 00:42:48.011
We agreed to meet.

00:42:49.311 --> 00:42:51.921
He's using the storage room as an office, right?

00:42:54.851 --> 00:42:55.921
You're here, Hye Na.

00:42:56.591 --> 00:42:58.261
- Go on inside. - Okay.

00:42:58.961 --> 00:43:00.491
Can we have two iced Americanos?

00:43:00.591 --> 00:43:01.991
Okay. I'll bring them over.

00:43:02.191 --> 00:43:03.761
No. I'll wait.

00:43:09.771 --> 00:43:13.671
I put in the menu you talked about last time.

00:43:14.171 --> 00:43:15.171
Okay.

00:43:17.611 --> 00:43:19.041
Good job, Hye Na.

00:43:19.241 --> 00:43:22.151
It looks bare without the company name or logo.

00:43:22.451 --> 00:43:23.481
I have that already.

00:43:23.751 --> 00:43:25.981
Put in the company name and logo for me.

00:43:26.181 --> 00:43:28.250
Let's do the search engine optimization today too. Here.

00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:29.721
(Making a website appear higher in the search result list)

00:43:31.921 --> 00:43:34.591
Hey, you prepared everything in advance.

00:43:34.931 --> 00:43:35.961
Of course, I did.

00:43:36.961 --> 00:43:38.001
I like it.

00:43:39.761 --> 00:43:42.401
They're looking at something on the screen and talking.

00:43:42.601 --> 00:43:44.671
- That's weird. - It is.

00:43:46.001 --> 00:43:48.141
It's like Ji Hyuk's a different person.

00:43:48.841 --> 00:43:51.211
Let's focus on work. I don't want to mind him.

00:43:54.051 --> 00:43:55.381
Hye Na. Come here.

00:43:56.951 --> 00:43:58.351
What did you do with Ji Hyuk?

00:43:58.551 --> 00:44:02.051
He asked me to make him a simple website.

00:44:02.321 --> 00:44:03.421
What website?

00:44:04.261 --> 00:44:06.060
He said you could all see it...

00:44:06.061 --> 00:44:07.890
when it launches.

00:44:07.891 --> 00:44:09.260
Oh, right.

00:44:09.261 --> 00:44:11.761
You studied computer engineering just like Eun Oh.

00:44:11.901 --> 00:44:13.561
Is that why he asked for your help?

00:44:14.131 --> 00:44:15.171
Yes.

00:44:15.301 --> 00:44:17.371
He got back just two days ago.

00:44:17.571 --> 00:44:20.201
About ten days ago? We met up then.

00:44:20.471 --> 00:44:22.241
- Where? - In Seoul.

00:44:23.841 --> 00:44:24.881
In Seoul?

00:44:26.581 --> 00:44:28.211
Were you surprised I called?

00:44:29.551 --> 00:44:30.580
Yes.

00:44:30.581 --> 00:44:33.551
You're going abroad to take a language course, right?

00:44:34.151 --> 00:44:35.151
Yes.

00:44:35.152 --> 00:44:37.191
How about taking a part-time job before you go?

00:44:37.961 --> 00:44:40.361
You're weird too, Hye Na.

00:44:40.491 --> 00:44:42.761
Why didn't you tell anyone you'd met up?

00:44:42.831 --> 00:44:45.231
Why should I tell anyone that?

00:44:46.101 --> 00:44:47.601
He asked me to do a job for him.

00:44:48.101 --> 00:44:50.100
What did you do today, then?

00:44:50.101 --> 00:44:51.341
The SEO process.

00:44:52.171 --> 00:44:54.441
That means the site is almost done.

00:44:54.571 --> 00:44:55.571
Yes.

00:44:55.641 --> 00:44:57.581
- I have to go now. - Okay.

00:44:58.381 --> 00:44:59.911
Hey, Eun Oh.

00:45:00.111 --> 00:45:02.451
Can you make a website in ten days?

00:45:03.381 --> 00:45:05.850
Well, if you're making a simple site,

00:45:05.851 --> 00:45:07.451
it can be done in days too.

00:45:07.751 --> 00:45:09.851
He's really driven.

00:45:11.361 --> 00:45:13.421
I'm dead curious.

00:45:13.521 --> 00:45:15.591
What business is he planning?

00:45:16.461 --> 00:45:18.401
It's no business. He's just bluffing.

00:45:19.201 --> 00:45:20.201
He's bluffing?

00:45:20.631 --> 00:45:22.331
He doesn't want to hide anymore,

00:45:22.431 --> 00:45:25.001
so he has to come back, but he's embarrassed he has nothing.

00:45:25.371 --> 00:45:27.671
So he's pretending to have a grand vision.

00:45:28.071 --> 00:45:29.311
Business is no joke.

00:45:29.471 --> 00:45:31.141
He can't launch that and a site in two months.

00:45:31.611 --> 00:45:32.811
If he were that capable,

00:45:33.041 --> 00:45:35.381
he'd have become a CEO long ago. Why did he work in an office?

00:45:36.151 --> 00:45:38.281
He came back to our hangout,

00:45:38.781 --> 00:45:40.151
where rumours spread the fastest.

00:45:40.591 --> 00:45:42.651
That's exactly why he came here.

00:45:42.821 --> 00:45:44.791
"I'm here to make a comeback."

00:45:45.061 --> 00:45:47.230
"But my business isn't doing so well."

00:45:47.231 --> 00:45:48.591
He'll give up...

00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:49.991
and find another job.

00:45:50.331 --> 00:45:51.331
And then...

00:45:52.831 --> 00:45:54.731
- And then what? - He'll disappear...

00:45:55.271 --> 00:45:56.631
from Value of Hangyeol.

00:45:58.871 --> 00:46:01.411
You're so clear headed but coldhearted.

00:46:01.571 --> 00:46:03.371
I've known him for ten years,

00:46:03.541 --> 00:46:06.481
and he never said he wanted to own a business.

00:46:07.211 --> 00:46:09.181
He got someone to make a website in just a few days.

00:46:09.381 --> 00:46:11.281
Do you know how simple that site would be?

00:46:11.881 --> 00:46:15.121
Not to mention, you need more than just a website to do business now.

00:46:15.251 --> 00:46:16.421
You need an app too.

Hey, I meant to call you.

00:46:36.151 --> 00:46:39.111
Yes. I'll launch the site soon.

00:46:39.581 --> 00:46:42.891
I'll send you the link now. It'll help with the planning.

00:46:43.991 --> 00:46:46.391
Of course. Do you want to invest?

00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:49.561
Then I'll give you a decent stake.

00:46:49.861 --> 00:46:52.430
Yes. I'm a bit busy right now.

00:46:52.431 --> 00:46:54.231
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

00:47:00.971 --> 00:47:02.701
Why is it so hot in here?

00:47:03.541 --> 00:47:04.571
My gosh.

00:47:05.041 --> 00:47:06.341
Do I need to buy an electric fan?

00:47:38.811 --> 00:47:39.811
What's that?

00:47:40.711 --> 00:47:41.911
When did the door close?

00:47:50.721 --> 00:47:51.791
What happened?

00:47:52.721 --> 00:47:53.761
How weird.

00:48:17.311 --> 00:48:18.311
What was that?

00:48:23.521 --> 00:48:24.850
My gosh.

00:48:24.851 --> 00:48:26.721
Your brother's wedding fell through.

00:48:28.391 --> 00:48:31.061
Yes. It so happened.

00:48:31.291 --> 00:48:32.331
Out of the blue?

00:48:32.791 --> 00:48:34.361
Your father is jobless,

00:48:35.161 --> 00:48:36.831
and your brother is now jobless too.

00:48:37.271 --> 00:48:38.871
All you have left...

00:48:39.001 --> 00:48:40.341
are your looks, youth, and education.

00:48:41.001 --> 00:48:42.271
You have just those three.

00:48:42.341 --> 00:48:43.341
So what?

00:48:43.841 --> 00:48:46.141
I'm a triangle, so I can't date a hexagonal man?

00:48:48.211 --> 00:48:49.341
I know that.

00:48:50.011 --> 00:48:51.181
What can you give up?

00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:53.780
The man's looks, age, education,

00:48:53.781 --> 00:48:56.291
background, occupation, assets. What of the six can you drop?

00:48:57.721 --> 00:48:59.590
I should pick a triangle?

00:48:59.591 --> 00:49:01.221
That's not what I mean.

00:49:01.791 --> 00:49:04.590
You have two strengths in that...

00:49:04.591 --> 00:49:06.560
you're young and pretty.

00:49:06.561 --> 00:49:09.901
You need to give up two things.

00:49:11.871 --> 00:49:13.341
His age and background.

00:49:13.471 --> 00:49:14.471
Okay.

00:49:15.441 --> 00:49:16.671
You chose wisely.

00:49:17.241 --> 00:49:18.540
A young man...

00:49:18.541 --> 00:49:20.680
is rarely rich with a good career.

00:49:20.681 --> 00:49:22.781
And you know what such men are like.

00:49:22.911 --> 00:49:24.151
They don't like women...

00:49:24.251 --> 00:49:25.981
who have nothing saved up.

00:49:26.421 --> 00:49:28.821
I didn't give up on his looks, though.

00:49:28.881 --> 00:49:30.891
I won't meet anyone like the last guy.

00:49:31.291 --> 00:49:33.491
And I want to see a photo that wasn't retouched.

Why do you think that is?

00:50:12.231 --> 00:50:13.231
Read the comments.

00:50:15.161 --> 00:50:16.570
Is he your real boyfriend?

00:50:16.571 --> 00:50:18.131
The ideal difference in height.

00:50:18.631 --> 00:50:21.800
I can only wear sneakers when I'm with my boyfriend.

00:50:21.801 --> 00:50:23.740
You two dress to complement each other,

00:50:23.741 --> 00:50:25.340
but I'd love to see his face too.

00:50:25.341 --> 00:50:27.980
I like this concept. Keep showing him.

00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:29.910
Post what your boyfriend's wearing.

00:50:29.911 --> 00:50:31.981
Can't you show your boyfriend's face?

How old is your brother?

00:50:42.221 --> 00:50:43.291
My oldest brother?

00:50:43.961 --> 00:50:45.631
He's 32 this year.

00:50:45.861 --> 00:50:47.130
Thirty-four if you follow the old system.

00:50:47.131 --> 00:50:48.201
I see.

00:50:50.301 --> 00:50:52.071

Lee Ha Eun, you. Dream on.

Seong Jae's a conglomerate heir.

00:50:58.911 --> 00:50:59.911
Really?

00:51:02.181 --> 00:51:03.981
No wonder he looked expensive.

00:51:06.151 --> 00:51:07.851
That's not what's important right now.

Did someone write about me on the intranet forum?

It's not that. Well...

You said you would only show me from the neck down.

How are you only checking it now when I uploaded it ages ago?

00:52:32.731 --> 00:52:35.441
Since you didn't say anything, I thought you were fine with it.

00:52:36.071 --> 00:52:37.071

You said you'd make sure I was only shown from the neck down.

That was our agreement.

00:52:52.951 --> 00:52:55.921
I trusted you, which is why I didn't check the video.

00:52:56.361 --> 00:52:57.761
I was going to,

00:52:58.261 --> 00:53:01.331

Without your face,

00:53:03.571 --> 00:53:05.701
it didn't work and even looked scary.

00:53:07.241 --> 00:53:09.171
Still, your face was blurred out.

Why you...

00:53:11.411 --> 00:53:13.410
It was hardly blurred, so anyone who knows me...

00:53:13.411 --> 00:53:14.841
can still tell it's me.

00:53:15.981 --> 00:53:19.011

Don't get cheeky, and edit the video.

Our living expenses?

00:54:44.571 --> 00:54:46.601
Why would you suddenly ask me that?

00:54:47.101 --> 00:54:48.600
You have a pretty good idea.

00:54:48.601 --> 00:54:50.971
I never paid much attention.

00:54:51.741 --> 00:54:54.081
What do we spend on the essentials?

00:54:54.811 --> 00:54:56.910
The mortgage payment on this house...

00:54:56.911 --> 00:54:58.111
is 830 dollars.

national health insurance, and the national pension...

00:55:03.891 --> 00:55:04.891
come to 1,000 dollars.

00:55:05.291 --> 00:55:07.691
We spend another 1,000 on food and necessities.

00:55:08.261 --> 00:55:09.660
We give 200 dollars to your mother...

00:55:09.661 --> 00:55:11.261
and 500 to my father.

00:55:11.391 --> 00:55:12.531
Plus, there's your pocket money.

00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:16.331
How much do you still need now that you aren't working anymore?

00:55:17.271 --> 00:55:19.101
Gosh, that's scary.

00:55:20.001 --> 00:55:22.771
It takes a lot of money for a family to get by.

00:55:23.201 --> 00:55:25.041
Well, we're a big family.

00:55:26.111 --> 00:55:28.281
Why are you worrying about this already?

00:55:28.711 --> 00:55:31.381
We still have your pension that Ji Hyuk left us.

00:55:34.521 --> 00:55:37.621

I'm thinking about studying to be an electrical technician.

00:55:43.261 --> 00:55:44.691
An electrical technician?

00:55:44.831 --> 00:55:46.660
Yes, but that's just the first step.

00:55:46.661 --> 00:55:49.761
My final goal is to be an electrical engineer.

00:55:49.831 --> 00:55:51.700
Being certified as one...

00:55:51.701 --> 00:55:53.230
will open up many opportunities.

00:55:53.231 --> 00:55:55.200
However, because I didn't major in science,

00:55:55.201 --> 00:55:57.240
I can't take the test right away.

00:55:57.241 --> 00:55:58.270
Instead,

00:55:58.271 --> 00:56:00.380
once I become an electrical technician...

00:56:00.381 --> 00:56:02.280
and work in the field for a year,

00:56:02.281 --> 00:56:05.410
I can take the test to become an industrial electrical engineer.

00:56:05.411 --> 00:56:07.580
A year from then,

00:56:07.581 --> 00:56:10.120
I'll be qualified to take the test...

00:56:10.121 --> 00:56:11.621
for an electrical engineer.

00:56:13.221 --> 00:56:15.221
Just listening to you explain it makes me dizzy.

00:56:16.761 --> 00:56:19.730
If being an electrical engineer makes it easier to get jobs,

00:56:19.731 --> 00:56:21.931
why don't all science majors go for it?

00:56:22.061 --> 00:56:24.070
The test isn't easy even for those...

00:56:24.071 --> 00:56:26.031
who majored in science.

00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:29.001
But you'll take it even though you aren't a science major?

00:56:29.401 --> 00:56:32.010
I'll prepare for the test while bringing in money...

00:56:32.011 --> 00:56:33.711
to support the family.

00:56:35.811 --> 00:56:39.481
How long does it usually take to become an electrical technician?

00:56:39.511 --> 00:56:42.521
About six months to a year.

00:56:43.021 --> 00:56:44.251
Look here, Mr. Lee.

00:56:44.821 --> 00:56:46.691
Don't you think this is more than you can chew?

00:56:48.121 --> 00:56:50.030
You should get yourself a simpler job like others,

00:56:50.031 --> 00:56:51.191
even if it pays less.

00:56:51.561 --> 00:56:53.500
We need to accept our situation.

00:56:53.501 --> 00:56:55.701
What are you talking about?

00:56:55.931 --> 00:56:59.070
Am I supposed to go on without a plan or future,

00:56:59.071 --> 00:57:01.700
looking for work and making nothing but chump change?

00:57:01.701 --> 00:57:04.171
We still need to see Ji Wan and Su Bin get married.

00:57:04.511 --> 00:57:05.571
Unbelievable.

00:57:06.071 --> 00:57:07.740
You've already made up your mind,

00:57:07.741 --> 00:57:09.481
so why bother explaining it to me?

00:57:10.281 --> 00:57:11.811
Well...

00:57:12.181 --> 00:57:14.351
I felt guilty for not discussing it with you.

00:57:16.991 --> 00:57:18.651
I couldn't stop you from doing this,

00:57:18.921 --> 00:57:20.691
and I don't have the guts to try.

00:57:21.291 --> 00:57:22.691
I don't know what other option we have.

00:57:23.061 --> 00:57:24.460
Since that's the case,

00:57:24.461 --> 00:57:27.031
trust me and be patient for six months.

00:57:27.201 --> 00:57:30.471
I'll become an electrical technician and find a job.

00:57:32.601 --> 00:57:34.901
Only on one condition.

00:57:36.041 --> 00:57:37.571
Don't bother with part-time jobs.

00:57:38.111 --> 00:57:39.471
Spend that time studying.

00:57:42.611 --> 00:57:44.451
Thanks for giving me your permission.

00:57:45.881 --> 00:57:48.151
This isn't me allowing it. You made this decision for us.

Right.

00:58:07.001 --> 00:58:08.100
I'll give you my number.

00:58:08.101 --> 00:58:10.241
Hold on. Can you text it to me?

00:58:10.341 --> 00:58:11.641
We're actually on our way out.

00:58:11.771 --> 00:58:12.811
"We?"

Hey.

Eun Oh, Director Seong Jae, and I have something going on.

00:58:20.821 --> 00:58:22.080
Are you ready to go?

00:58:22.081 --> 00:58:23.181
Yes.

00:58:23.551 --> 00:58:26.490
Director Seong Jae, are you sure you're dressed right for this?

00:58:26.491 --> 00:58:28.590
You can always change into something a bit more casual.

00:58:28.591 --> 00:58:30.190
I should, for our next session.

00:58:30.191 --> 00:58:32.191
- Let's get going. - Let's go.

00:58:32.731 --> 00:58:33.761
I'll see you around.

00:58:35.531 --> 00:58:39.331
Ji Hyuk, can you make sure to lock up?

00:58:43.001 --> 00:58:44.041
Let's go.

00:58:45.371 --> 00:58:46.371
See?

00:58:46.471 --> 00:58:48.211
Have those three always been close?

00:58:51.251 --> 00:58:52.611
They weren't.

What's this?

00:59:48.341 --> 00:59:50.341
Ggang Oh, were you out drinking yesterday?

00:59:50.841 --> 00:59:53.580
You're the one who drank, since you came home after 2am.

00:59:53.581 --> 00:59:55.381
Why else would Mom have made a hangover soup?

00:59:55.981 --> 00:59:56.981
Me?

00:59:57.281 --> 00:59:59.811
Mom, I wasn't out drinking.

00:59:59.951 --> 01:00:02.351
Why did you get home after 2am when you weren't even drinking?

01:00:03.591 --> 01:00:04.790
I was out playing a video game.

01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:06.821
I told you I'd be doing so once a week.

01:00:07.961 --> 01:00:10.430
They say late beginners are the most diligent.

01:00:10.431 --> 01:00:11.431
But I doubt the game is that fun.

01:00:11.432 --> 01:00:13.131
You probably just need a distraction.

01:00:13.391 --> 01:00:16.631
Not this, again. Watch what you say to your sister.

01:00:17.501 --> 01:00:19.970
Ggang Oh, you must not care about an allowance anymore,

01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:22.371
seeing as you won't even call me your sister.

01:00:22.801 --> 01:00:24.971
Maybe he's maturing.

01:00:25.441 --> 01:00:27.711
I'm dying to tell you, but I won't.

01:00:28.381 --> 01:00:29.611
Not until it's time.

01:00:30.351 --> 01:00:33.311
Sure, of course. Everyone has their own timing.

I can't. I'm meeting a client.

01:00:40.121 --> 01:00:42.490
I got an interior design job for an apartment unit...

01:00:42.491 --> 01:00:43.691
and need to see it in person.

You might have to change all the windows too.

That's the plan.

The cafe's closed today, and it'll be just us.

01:01:46.051 --> 01:01:47.521
Why should I feel uncomfortable?

01:02:09.081 --> 01:02:10.481
What's that?

There are no windows.

It was suffocating, and Hyeon Su let me put in a window.

01:02:25.231 --> 01:02:27.901
This way, I can see into the cafe from my desk.

You have no idea how hard I'm trying.

I can't see you even if I stand up.

01:02:34.741 --> 01:02:37.041
And you can't see me when you stand up.

01:02:37.541 --> 01:02:38.740
That's why I put it high up.

01:02:38.741 --> 01:02:39.741
Why?

01:02:39.971 --> 01:02:42.241
Why not let it open to let in fresh air?

You'll keep doing this.

01:02:49.881 --> 01:02:51.720
I kept closing your door,

01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:53.591
so you got Hyeon Su to let you keep it open.

01:02:53.861 --> 01:02:55.190
You felt suffocated,

01:02:55.191 --> 01:02:57.691
so you got Hyeon Su to let you work in the cafe.

01:02:58.131 --> 01:03:00.700
Because what Hyeon Su says goes,

01:03:00.701 --> 01:03:03.531

01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:05.970
No, it's not like that.

It is like that.

01:03:08.471 --> 01:03:10.611
I didn't know you could be so manipulative.

01:03:12.041 --> 01:03:14.241
Fine. I got it.

Don't act like you know me. Don't say hello.

Don't talk to me.
