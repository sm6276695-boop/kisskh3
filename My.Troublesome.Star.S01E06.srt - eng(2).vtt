[Episode 6]
Give me the price chart.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.620
Okay.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.940
What's the contract fee ratio
for the D-Level clients?

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.000
We determine the D-Level prices
on a case-by-case basis.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.630
Because you yelled at Director Kang
for lowering our quality-

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.190
Geez, why is it so noisy?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.810
What's going on?

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.640
Let go!

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.300
- Seriously...
- Should I go down there?

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.650
- No, wait and see what she does.
- I'm begging you for a reason.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.500
I told you Du Won and I are very close.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.620
If he knew I was here,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.300
he'd be running out of there barefoot.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.220
Gosh, whatever.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.540
Yes.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.230
Let her in.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.660
Wow, is this really Im Se Ra?

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.760
Wow. You became so pretty. I almost...

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.800
I almost didn't recognize you.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.900
Come here. How long has it been? Come here.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.720
I came to check something.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.380
Let me go first. I was actually going to meet you.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.940
Although you beat me to it.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.490
Me?

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.980
Why?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.070
I want to talk privately.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.660
It's okay. Tell me.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.380
It's a private matter between just us.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.020
Who's he?

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.110
This is my-

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.800
I'm her manager.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.860
Come on. What manager, all of a sudden?

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.680
Is he really your manager?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.530
So, the thing is...

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.270
Yes, I am.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.530
So, talk to her through me from now on.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.760
You were so impressive back in the day.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.380
Working under your real name
without revealing you're Im Se Ra

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.640
was a great idea. It's a stroke of genius.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.160
Keep working like this,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.150
get attention, and reveal out of the blue.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.510
Then, you'll have your second heyday.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.200
You used to only eat one piece of sushi

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.700
and never ate more than three pieces of sashimi.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.990
Eat more. It's okay.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.110
Why is it so cold in here?

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.920
Let me get you a blanket.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.070
Well, a heater would be better.

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.280
Gosh, hey.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.740
My face will dry out.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.760
Yes, I'll turn the floor heater on...

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.370
Shit.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.640
Man...

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.440
Being light on your feet used to
be your only good quality.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.090
That was forever ago.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.730
You still think I'm a road manager
who used to serve you?

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.090
I know.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.380
You're so successful. Why did you
ignore me all this time?

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.510
When did I ignore you?

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.520
I couldn't meet you since
I didn't know where you were.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.370
You were hiding. It was impossible to find you.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.540
As the CEO of the biggest entertainment
company in the country,

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.260
isn't it easy to find someone if you wanted to?

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.130
How could I find someone who's determined to hide?

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.240
I'm not even a cop.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.430
She was determined to hide?

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.760
Why?

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.120
Was there a reason she had to hide?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.580
What are you trying to do with me?

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.760
You said you were going to meet me.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.080
Let's hear about it.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.330
Why did you suddenly want to see me?

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.240
Is he really your manager?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.370
I suppose I look like an actor.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.740
He's been with me since I started working again.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.620
Come on now. You can't sign a contract so rashly.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.720
You've always been so trusting.
I told you to be careful.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.140
I know.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.130
Because I was so trusting,

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.570
I trusted you, too.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.010
What does that mean?

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.690
Since we're on the topic,

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.030
what happened?

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.490
Tae Suk told me.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.560
Twenty-five years ago, on the day
of the award ceremony,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.710
you didn't let Tae Suk and Seon Yeong

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.430
in the car, talking about a surprise party.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.430
And I got into an accident
while I was alone in the car.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.330
Why are you asking me that now?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.750
By chance, do you not remember?

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.790
It's not that I don't remember-

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.060
It's just to make sure.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.140
They say that the accident
could've been a criminal case.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.650
Criminal case?

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.060
Yes.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.360
Noona, don't get hung up on the past.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.190
You had a comeback.
Things are starting to work out.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.210
You should think about the future, then.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.310
Answer me.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.810
What were you doing then?

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.380
Back then?

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.060
I told you everything.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.810
You told me?

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.120
- When?
- Huh?

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.290
The day you woke up at the hospital,

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.740
I ran there to see you. Don't you remember?

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.190
Wow. That would make me so sad.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.060
[Medical Chart]

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.220
Memory loss?

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.230
Wow.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.010
It was about three or four months later.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.110
When she woke up miraculously.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.290
Was it?

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.570
I can't remember because it was long ago.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.480
I know. It's been too long.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.170
Thanks for the meal.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.250
I didn't think you'd treat me
to an expensive meal in my lifetime.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.480
You have many days ahead.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.740
We'll share those happy days.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.830
Did you mean it when you said
to ask for help anytime?

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.930
Two One Entertainment is ready to...

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.330
help you proactively anytime.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.830
Get in.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.690
Manager, give me your business card.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.980
Pardon?

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.080
I didn't bring it because I left in a hurry.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.900
Come on. Business cards for managers are basic.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.800
It's like a cop going after
a culprit without a gun.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.320
Right.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.890
If so... One second.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.170
Give me your phone number. I'll text you.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.380
Okay. I'll be in touch, then.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.270
Okay. See you, Noona.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.910
Bye.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.400
Aigoo, get a new car.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.580
- Aigoo.
- Okay, okay.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.430
Bye!

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.910
Look into the number I just got a text from.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.680
What should I look into?

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.990
Your grave site, maybe?

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.770
I'm sorry.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.370
What happened?

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.550
Did you get a new phone?

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.120
I carry a second one just in case.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.020
One that can't be tracked.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.300
Of course.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.460
Since you used to be a detective,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.140
you're so thorough.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.830
I admit it.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.850
What's this, by the way?

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.700
It's nothing.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.880
Is it a gift?

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.050
Geez. What gift, all of a sudden?

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.020
I brought the leftovers from earlier.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.420
I wanted to have it for dinner.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.050
Is there some for me, too?

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.850
Come on.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.250
Anyway, didn't you want to confirm
something with CEO Kang?

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.280
He lied too blatantly for that.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.870
Lied?

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.800
How do you know if he lied?

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.390
He might've forgotten,
but 25 years ago feels like yesterday.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.650
I remember it clearly.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.550
Twenty-five years ago, on the day
of the award ceremony,

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.730
what were you doing then?

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.310
Back then?

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.060
Whenever he's put on the spot,

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.390
he wets his lips and speaks with an accent.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.590
I told you everything.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.700
The day you woke up at the hospital,

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.200
I ran there to see you. Don't you remember?

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.210
Wow. That would make me so sad.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.590
That's how I knew he was lying.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.320
And...

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.250
Just once.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.260
Please, just once.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.110
You can't work with Director Choi.
Everything would be over!

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.740
Never mind.

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.800
Why did you say you were my manager earlier?

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.300
I couldn't think of anything else to say.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.930
You said you won't be my manager even if I begged.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.240
The world you're trying to return to.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.910
The culprit is in there.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.520
You aren't safe until we catch the culprit.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.800
Was it because you were worried about me?

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.190
Are you trying to go undercover

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.200
and be by my side?

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.400
Are you shooting a drama or something?
What's she saying?

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.000
Right, how did you know earlier?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.260
You said Im Se Ra woke up from
a coma after three or four months.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.040
I didn't see that anywhere in the articles.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.870
People miraculously wake up
after three or four months in dramas.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.970
Go in. I'm leaving.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.590
Hold on.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.610
Split the sushi?

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.590
What's your relationship with the madam?

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.770
He used to only watch "Jewelry Shop Girl."

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.390
But he got sucked into a current drama for once.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:54.010
Right. Your sister paid all the overdue bills.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.030
My sister...

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.500
Her name is...

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.060
Ms. Bong Cheong Ja.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.950
She stopped by recently.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.980
Didn't she tell you?

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:14.090
Father, I'll be back next month.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.150
Okay?

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.730
Who are you?

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.910
I heard Se Ra was here.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.730
Se Ra? Se Ra was here?

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.090
Sit. Stay seated.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.420
Your legs are weak.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.540
Se Ra was here?

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.870
Let me see her, please?

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.960
Do you have only one daughter, Father?

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.370
I was by your side for 20 years,

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.900
but you never recognized me once.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.680
How could you only remember Se Ra's name?

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.130
Father...

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.600
ever since I was in 12th grade,

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.690
I couldn't go to college because
I looked after you in prison.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.220
I'm the one who took care
of you when you got sick.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.790
It wasn't Se Ra.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.190
I'm sorry.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.410
Forgive me.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.300
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.210
I'm sorry. Forgive me. Forgive me.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.780
I'm sorry, Father.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.490
What's wrong with me?

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.040
I-I'm sorry.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.200
I'm sorry.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.100
I'll go.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.540
Se Ra.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.960
Se Ra...

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.160
We got the edited script.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.430
It was edited again?

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.620
Thank you.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.340
What? What's with the script?

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.670
My gosh.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.640
My part is much more this time.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.430
Hey.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.710
Hey.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.460
Did you bribe the writer?

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.730
What bullshit are you saying now?

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.610
Bullshit?

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.460
Just think about it.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.970
The housekeeper only had a few scenes last week.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:18.850
Look at your new lines. How does this make sense?

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:22.890
You must be upset that I got more parts than you.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.100
You need to know your place.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.590
When a newbie replaces the old guard,

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.360
things always go wrong in this field.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.920
Just pray that I fail, why don't you?

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.170
Can you even fail further?

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.810
The one and only Im Se Ra turned out like this-

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.240
Watch your mouth.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.420
Bong Cheong Ja. Bong Cheong Ja. Ms. Bong.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.260
That's exactly where you stand in this house.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.010
You're a housekeeper who makes kkakdugi.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.380
If you stick out more,

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.060
your true identity will be revealed. Be careful.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:20.040
You don't believe that you're the
madam's only man, do you?

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.900
What are you saying?

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:29.510
Whose baby do you think she's pregnant with?

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.820
Are you saying it's not mine?

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.420
Tell me. Tell me now.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.930
Let go. Let go of me.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.040
Let go!

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.960
You!

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.860
Sorry.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.480
I couldn't control my strength.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.530
I'm sorry.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.340
You!

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.030
You!

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.810
This is that radish.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.100
Look how nice it looks.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.370
It needs to be on this level
to have a crunchy texture.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.900
I hope you get some today.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.770
You've gotten prettier since you've been on TV.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.890
You should've told me you were an actor.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:53.770
I'm not really. I'm just a minor role actor.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.540
You're in a daily drama.
Of course, you are an actor.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.550
You're a top star. A top star.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.660
Yes, yes. So impressive.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.870
- Please continue to watch our drama.
- Of course!

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.260
You can't forget about us.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.960
Of course not. How could I?

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.450
Give me another autograph. I'll give it to my son.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.600
- Excuse me...
- Da Hui.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.560
- Will you not come here anymore?
- No. It worked out that way.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.630
You must've been embarrassed by me.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.490
Do you have something to say to me?

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.600
Well...

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.630
I need to submit something
to school. Please sign this.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.740
You want my signature?

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.840
Why? Why don't you ask your mom?

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.600
She's busy at the shop.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.300
I hardly get to see her when I'm home after class.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.070
- Can't you?
- It's your report card, isn't it?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.620
You got a bad grade, didn't you?

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.170
Okay. Give it to me.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:02.630
Geez. So many people want my autograph today.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.040
You need to study, okay?

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.370
Thank you.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.910
Wait.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.190
Because of my situation,

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.590
I haven't been able to give you pocket money.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:19.730
It's okay.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.600
I'll work hard and...

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.680
repay your mom for the things I feel bad about

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.210
and pay Grandpa's nursing home bills, too.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.250
So, you just need to study hard.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.790
Okay?

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.270
Promise.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.370
- You can't do this again.
- Okay.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.760
Go.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.140
Which would be good?

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.390
Should I try this?

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:51.790
Hit me with it.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.950
You bastard!

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.380
It doesn't look so good.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.890
Too similar to the radish, right?
What would be good?

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.430
- Green onion slap?
- Green onion slap?

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.450
Maybe a kudzu root would work.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:05.940
How about we change the category?

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.010
Category? Like what?

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.430
How about a living creature?

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:12.910
- Octopus?
- Octopus?

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.050
I throw an octopus, but it sticks to his face.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.660
So, I can't remove it. Stuff like that?

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.860
Yes, stuff like that.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.970
They've lost it.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.490
That sounds so painful, right?

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.290
Crab sounds good.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.400
[Seoul Police - Dokgo Cheol]

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.740
Here. Call me if you find it.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.230
Hyungnim.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.690
How long has he been following us?

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.140
It's been about 15 days.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.430
He's that bastard from then, right?

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:05.870
Yes.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.230
We're ready.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.040
I got so scared because you took so long.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.430
I thought you weren't coming.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.260
I was surprised that you demanded the balance.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.930
You didn't even do a good job.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.590
Geez. How much more could I have done?

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.000
I risked my life when I did that, too.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.950
That ahjumma just won't die. What am I to do?

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.070
Is it the right amount?

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.320
Looks like you don't have much to take.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.740
- Just for you, right?
- What are you talking about?

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.320
I got you a boat that leaves tomorrow night.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.210
Pack your stuff and leave.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:04.620
Go where? You want me to go abroad?

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.160
Shit. That's not what you promised.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.500
An annoying bastard is after us.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:11.410
It's better than going to jail, right?

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.990
Aren't you on probation?

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:23.200
Sweetie, you think I'd go to jail alone?

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.070
Are you having fun?

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.360
Who would you take with you?

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.090
Let go...

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.610
For me to go for just a few pennies...

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.450
Five times more.

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.110
No, no. Pay me ten times more.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:46.350
I'll leave the country quietly, then.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.080
- I'll pay you.
- Please.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.160
But do it right this time. Got it?

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.720
Of course.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.320
Could it be the same ahjumma? Again?

00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.610
Ten times more.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.290
15...

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.840
Okay. Okay.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.690
The offender of the car accident, you know.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.150
Didn't he leave abroad?

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.120
- He didn't.
- I thought he disappeared.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.660
He moved out, and he hasn't used his card.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.760
He could've fled already if he wanted to.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.540
He'll flee soon.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.700
Once the transaction ends.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.260
It sounds like you know where he is.

Gosh, that's not true.

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.040
Im Se Ra wasn't on top for no reason.

Yes. I'm aware.

In what aspect do you think you're
better than Im Se Ra, Go Hui Yeong?

00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:00.730
That'd be a strong desire.

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:03.880
No matter what attitude she had while acting,

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.380
my desire is way stronger than hers.

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.350
I don't care if I get paid less.

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:12.390
I can do all the scenes she rejected, too.

Can you do anything you're
asked outside the set, too?

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:29.280
Im Se Ra would be ousted even
if she wasn't in the accident.

Do you know why?

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:37.300
Because she couldn't deliver what the
most important investor wanted.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.980
You were always a substitute for Im Se Ra.

00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:01.490
But let's say Im Se Ra returns.

- Take it off.

Take what off?

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:59.240
Hey, hold on. What are you doing?

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.640
What else? You need to be treated.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:07.120
That's not necessary. I'm fine.

Do you want to be dragged to the hospital?

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:13.670
Sit. Come on.

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:15.170
Hurry.

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:18.670
Hurry up and take it off.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:20.940

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.680
Let me look.

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.080
It's just a scratch.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.930
Gosh. What do we do?

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:34.700
It needs to be disinfected.

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.200
It doesn't need to be disinfected.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.400
I'm sorry.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.660
About what?

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.960
You got injured because of me.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.770
Geez, come on.

I could've knocked him down
at once if I were my old self.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.700
It's because I'm rusty. It's not your fault.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:54.600
- It stings!
- My gosh!

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.970
Why did you have to leave your phone?

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:17.780
I'll make sure to carry it from now on.

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.360
I'll remember to charge it, too.

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:22.170
Remember to carry it. Don't scare me like that.

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:24.940
Did you get scared because of me?

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:28.390
Of course, I was.

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:31.830
You couldn't be reached, and
a crazy man was lurking around you.

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:34.820
I thought something might happen.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.300
What if something happened?

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:40.260
That wouldn't be good.

00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:46.860
Well... um...

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:49.670
You're a victim of the case I'm in charge of.

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:51.800
O-Of course...

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.580
Is that all?

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:02.480
What else, then...

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.370
Well,

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.290
what I was trying to say was...

00:52:20.970 --> 00:52:23.100
By chance,

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:27.110
is it related to what happened today?

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:34.250
I think so.

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:42.380
I'm asking why you didn't tell me
Bong Cheong Ja is Im Se Ra!

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:52.510
Everyone knew.

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:55.950
Only I didn't know like a fool.

00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:57.630
Unni.

00:52:57.630 --> 00:53:02.500
I was going to tell you as soon as I confirmed-

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.940
What are you up to, dragging Im Se Ra in?

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:11.610
He dragged her in?

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:14.300
I already know everything.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:17.170
I heard you're bringing her into Two One.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:19.260
CEO Kang, how could you...

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:22.500
Gosh, you're crazy!

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:27.520
Gosh. I can't stand how funny this is.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.160
Why are you freaking out?

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.380
She's not the old Im Se Ra.

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:34.390
She's just Bong Cheong Ja. Bong Cheong Ja.

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:38.260
You came to me this late because
you're scared of an ahjumma?

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:42.600
The Cannes queen, Go Hui Yeong,
and the mighty Shably?

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.330
If Im Se Ra shows up,

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:47.950
I won't be the only one to go down.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:52.030
You'll go down, too.

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:54.730
I know! Shit!

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:00.780
Just shut up and watch, both of you.

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:04.570
See how I destroy Bong Cheong Ja this time.

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:06.050
Okay?

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:08.580
Okay?

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:13.650
Geez, seriously.

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:26.800
So, this person tried to kill me 25 years ago,

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:31.140
and he again tried to kill me
in a car accident recently?

00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:34.270
It's not for certain. But...

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:36.830
the same man on both accident scenes-

00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:39.100
That means the two accidents...

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:42.760
didn't just happen by chance.

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:57.100
It's your fault! It's your fault!

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:06.900
I met this man a month before the accident.

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:11.420
Is he the man you suddenly remembered?

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:31.980
So, you insist on coming out to the world, huh?

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.720
I'll find him.

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:51.970
I'll make him come to me.

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:53.930
Not only did he try to kill me,

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:56.920
he ruined my life, too.

00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:00.900
I'll make sure to catch him myself.

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:04.740
He blatantly hurt Im Se Ra,
whom the whole country knows.

00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:07.600
What if that happens again?

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.400
- If it does-
- Right now,

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.270

I know she was hospitalized here after surgery.

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.280
What's your relationship with her?

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:23.150
Actually, I'm...

00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:25.530
Se Ra's father.

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:29.140
Could you show me your ID?

00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:40.360
I said I'll see my daughter just once before I go!

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.740
I'm really Im Se Ra's dad.

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.220
I don't know when I'd be released this time.

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:48.660
Let me see my daughter just once. Just once.

00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:52.090
Okay, okay. Let's talk at the station.

What is it? What is it?

00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:56.940
Well, I'm...

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.360
a detective from a Busan police station.

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:00.470
What's this about?

00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:01.880
The thing is...

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:05.030
He's Bong Seok Bong, who's wanted, right?

00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:07.200
- Yes, that's him.
- I'm his detective-in-charge.

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.460
- I'll transfer him.
- Pardon?

00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:12.740

talk to my team leader?

You'll go later,

but you should see your daughter first.

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:31.370
My Se Ra is in here?

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:32.940
Make it quick.

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:35.160
I can't wait long.

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.570
Thank you.

00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:39.760
Thank you, Detective. Thank you.

My daughter is lying down like a corpse.

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:21.910
But her father is trapped in here like this.

00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:23.820
You caused trouble,

00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:27.840
ran away, but you also disappeared.

00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:45.600
I mentioned last time?

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:46.810
Why do you ask?

00:59:46.810 --> 00:59:50.440
It's getting cold these days.

00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:54.010
Could you ask her to send me some money?

00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:58.450
She's just a high schooler.
How could you ask that?

00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:02.140
